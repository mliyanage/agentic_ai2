Microsoft has been releasing container \\ninnovations for Windows and Linux by creating products like Azure Kubernetes Service and Azure \\nService Fabric, and by partnering with industry leaders like Docker, Mesosphere, and Kubernetes. \\nThese products deliver container solutions that help companies build and deploy applications at cloud \\nspeed and scale, whatever their choice of platform or tools. \\nDocker is becoming the de facto standard in the container industry, supported by the most significant \\nvendors in the Windows and Linux ecosystems. (Microsoft is one of the main cloud vendors \\nsupporting Docker.) In the future, Docker will probably be ubiquitous in any datacenter in the cloud or \\non-premises. \\nIn addition, the microservices architecture is emerging as an important approach for distributed \\nmission-critical applications. In a microservice-based architecture, the application is built on a \\ncollection of services that can be developed, tested, deployed, and versioned independently.  \\nAbout this guide \\nThis guide is an introduction to developing microservices-based applications and managing them \\nusing containers. It discusses architectural design and implementation approaches using .NET and \\nDocker containers. To make it easier to get started with containers and microservices, the guide \\nfocuses on a reference containerized and microservice-based application that you can explore.

Our intention is that you read \\nthis guide when thinking about your application design without focusing on the infrastructure (cloud \\nor on-premises) of your production environment. You will make decisions about your infrastructure \\nlater, when you create your production-ready applications. Therefore, this guide is intended to be \\ninfrastructure agnostic and more development-environment-centric. \\nAfter you have studied this guide, your next step would be to learn about production -ready \\nmicroservices on Microsoft Azure. \\nVersion \\nThis guide has been revised to cover .NET 6 version along with many additional updates related to \\nthe same “wave” of technologies (that is, Azure and additional third-party technologies) coinciding in \\ntime with the .NET 6 release. That’s why the book version has also been updated to version 6.0. \\nWhat this guide does not cover \\nThis guide does not focus on the application lifecycle, DevOps, CI/CD pipelines, or team work. The \\ncomplementary guide Containerized Docker Application Lifecycle with Microsoft Platform and Tools \\nfocuses on that subject. The current guide also does not provide implementation details on Azure \\ninfrastructure, such as information on specific orchestrators. \\nAdditional resources \\n• Containerized Docker Application Lifecycle with Microsoft Platform and Tools  \\n(downloadable e-book) \\nhttps://aka.ms/dockerlifecycleebook \\nWho should use this guide \\nWe wrote this guide for developers and solution architects who are new to Docker -based application \\ndevelopment and to microservices-based architecture. This guide is for you if you want to learn how \\nto architect, design, and implement proof-of-concept applications with Microsoft development \\ntechnologies (with special focus on .NET) and with Docker containers. \\nYou will also find this guide useful if you are a technical decision maker, such as an enterprise \\narchitect, who wants an architecture and technology overview before you decide on what approach to \\nselect for new and modern distributed applications. \\nHow to use this guide \\nThe first part of this guide introduces Docker containers, discusses how to choose between .NET 6 and \\nthe .NET Framework as a development framework, and provides an overview of microservices.

This section will be of most interest to developers and architects who want to focus \\non code and on patterns and implementation details. \\nRelated microservice and container-based reference \\napplication: eShopOnContainers \\nThe eShopOnContainers application is an open-source reference app for .NET and microservices that \\nis designed to be deployed using Docker containers. The application consists of multiple subsystems, \\nincluding several e-store UI front-ends (a Web MVC app, a Web SPA, and a native mobile app). It also \\nincludes the back-end microservices and containers for all required server-side operations. \\nThe purpose of the application is to showcase architectural patterns. IT IS NOT A PRODUCTION-\\nREADY TEMPLATE to start real-world applications. In fact, the application is in a permanent beta \\nstate, as it’s also used to test new potentially interesting technologies as they show up. \\nSend us your feedback! \\nWe wrote this guide to help you understand the architecture of containerized applications and \\nmicroservices in .NET.

The containerized application can be tested as a unit and deployed as a \\ncontainer image instance to the host operating system (OS). \\nJust as shipping containers allow goods to be transported by ship, train, or truck regardless of the \\ncargo inside, software containers act as a standard unit of software deployment that can contain \\ndifferent code and dependencies. Containerizing software this way enables developers and IT \\nprofessionals to deploy them across environments with little or no modification.  \\nContainers also isolate applications from each other on a shared OS. Containerized applications run \\non top of a container host that in turn runs on the OS (Linux or Windows). Containers therefore have a \\nsignificantly smaller footprint than virtual machine (VM) images. \\nEach container can run a whole web application or a service, as shown in Figure 2-1. In this example, \\nDocker host is a container host, and App1, App2, Svc 1, and Svc 2 are containerized applications or \\nservices. \\n \\nFigure 2-1.

You can scale out quickly by creating new containers \\nfor short-term tasks. From an application point of view, instantiating an image (creating a container) is \\nsimilar to instantiating a process like a service or a web app. For reliability, however, when you run \\nmultiple instances of the same image across multiple host servers, you typically want each container \\n(image instance) to run in a different host server or VM in different fault domains.  \\nIn short, containers offer the benefits of isolation, portability, agility, scalability, and control across the \\nwhole application lifecycle workflow. The most important benefit is the environment’s isolation \\nprovided between Dev and Ops. \\nWhat is Docker? \\nDocker is an open-source project for automating the deployment of applications as portable, self-\\nsufficient containers that can run on the cloud or on-premises. Docker is also a company that \\npromotes and evolves this technology, working in collaboration with cloud, Linux, and Windows \\nvendors, including Microsoft. \\n \\nFigure 2-2. Docker deploys containers at all layers of the hybrid cloud. \\nDocker containers can run anywhere, on-premises in the customer datacenter, in an external service \\nprovider or in the cloud, on Azure. Docker image containers can run natively on Linux and Windows. \\nHowever, Windows images can run only on Windows hosts and Linux images can run on Linux hosts \\nand Windows hosts (using a Hyper-V Linux VM, so far), where host means a server or a VM. \\nDevelopers can use development environments on Windows, Linux, or macOS. On the develo pment \\ncomputer, the developer runs a Docker host where Docker images are deployed, including the app \\nand its dependencies. Developers who work on Linux or on macOS use a Docker host that is Linux \\nbased, and they can create images only for Linux containers. (Developers working on macOS can edit \\ncode or run the Docker CLI from macOS, but as of the time of this writing, containers don’t run'),\n",

These products install the necessary VM (the Docker \\nhost) to host the containers. \\nTo run Windows Containers, there are two types of runtimes: \\n• Windows Server Containers provide application isolation through process and namespace \\nisolation technology. A Windows Server Container shares a kernel with the container host and \\nwith all containers running on the host. \\n• Hyper-V Containers expand on the isolation provided by Windows Server Containers by running \\neach container in a highly optimized virtual machine. In this configuration, the kernel of the \\ncontainer host isn’t shared with the Hyper-V Containers, providing better isolation. \\nThe images for these containers are created the same way and function the same. The difference is in \\nhow the container is created from the image running a Hyper-V Container requires an extra \\nparameter.

Full virtualization requires \\nmore resources than containerization. \\nContainers include the application and all its \\ndependencies. However, they share the OS kernel \\nwith other containers, running as isolated \\nprocesses in user space on the host operating \\nsystem. (Except in Hyper-V containers, where \\neach container runs inside of a special virtual \\nmachine per container.) \\nFigure 2-3. Comparison of traditional virtual machines to Docker containers \\nFor VMs, there are three base layers in the host server, from the bottom-up: infrastructure, Host \\nOperating System and a Hypervisor and on top of all that each VM has its own OS and all necessary \\nlibraries. For Docker, the host server only has the infrastructure and the OS and on top of that, the \\ncontainer engine, that keeps container isolated but sharing the base OS services.  \\nBecause containers require far fewer resources (for example, they don’t need a full OS), they’re easy to \\ndeploy and they start fast. This allows you to have higher density, meaning that it allows you to run \\nmore services on the same hardware unit, thereby reducing costs. \\nAs a side effect of running on the same kernel, you get less isolation than VMs.  \\nThe main goal of an image is that it makes the environment (dependencies) the same across different \\ndeployments. This means that you can debug it on your machine and then deploy it to another \\nmachine with the same environment guaranteed. \\nA container image is a way to package an app or service and deploy it in a reliable and reproducible \\nway. You could say that Docker isn’t only a technology but also a philosophy and a process.  \\nWhen using Docker, you won’t hear developers say, “It works on my machine, why not in production?” \\nThey can simply say, “It runs on Docker”, because the packaged Docker application can be executed \\non any supported Docker environment, and it runs the way it was intended to on all deployment \\ntargets (such as Dev, QA, staging, and production). \\nA simple analogy \\nPerhaps a simple analogy can help getting the grasp of the core concept of Docker. \\nLet’s go back in time to the 1950s for a moment. There were no word processors, and the \\nphotocopiers were used everywhere (kind of). \\nImagine you’re responsible for quickly issuing batches of letters as required, to mail them to \\ncustomers, using real paper and envelopes, to be delivered physically to each customer’s address \\n(there was no email back then). \\nAt some point, you realize the letters are just a composition of a large set of paragraphs, which are \\npicked and arranged as needed, according to the purpose of the letter, so you devise a system to \\nissue letters quickly, expecting to get a hefty raise. \\nThe system is simple: \\n1. You begin with a deck of transparent sheets containing one paragraph each.'),\n",

To issue a set of letters, you pick the sheets with the paragraphs you need, then you stack and \\nalign them so they look and read fine. \\n3. Finally, you place the set in the photocopier and press start to produce as many letters as \\nrequired. \\nSo, simplifying, that’s the core idea of Docker. \\nIn Docker, each layer is the resulting set of changes that happen to the filesystem after executing a \\ncommand, such as, installing a program. \\nSo, when you “look” at the filesystem after the layer has been copied, you see all the files, included in \\nthe layer when the program was installed. \\nYou can think of an image as an auxiliary read-only hard disk ready to be installed in a “computer” \\nwhere the operating system is already installed. \\nSimilarly, you can think of a container as the “computer” with the image hard disk installed. The \\ncontainer, just like a computer, can be powered on or off. \\nDocker terminology \\nThis section lists terms and definitions you should be familiar with before getting deeper into Docker. \\nFor further definitions, see the extensive glossary provided by Docker. \\nContainer image: A package with all the dependencies and information needed to create a container. \\nAn image includes all the dependencies (such as frameworks) plus deployment and execution \\nconfiguration to be used by a container runtime. Usually, an image derives from multiple base images \\nthat are layers stacked on top of each other to form the container’s filesystem. An image is immutable \\nonce it has been created. \\nDockerfile: A text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It’s like a batch script, \\nthe first line states the base image to begin with and then follow the instructions to install required \\nprograms, copy files, and so on, until you get the working environment you need.  \\nBuild: The action of building a container image based on the information and context provided by its \\nDockerfile, plus additional files in the folder where the image is built. You can build images with the \\nfollowing Docker command: \\ndocker build \\nContainer: An instance of a Docker image. A container represents the execution of a single \\napplication, process, or service. It consists of the contents of a Docker image, an execution \\nenvironment, and a standard set of instructions. When scaling a service, you create multiple instances \\nof a container from the same image. Or a batch job can create multiple containers from the same \\nimage, passing different parameters to each instance. \\nVolumes: Offer a writable filesystem that the container can use. Since images are read-only but most \\nprograms need to write to the filesystem, volumes add a writable layer, on top of the container image, \\nso the programs have access to a writable filesystem. The program doesn’t know it’s accessing a'),\n",

Volumes live in the host system and are managed \\nby Docker. \\nTag: A mark or label you can apply to images so that different images or versions of the same image \\n(depending on the version number or the target environment) can be identified. \\nMulti-stage Build: Is a feature, since Docker 17.05 or higher, that helps to reduce the size of the final \\nimages. For example, a large base image, containing the SDK can be used for compiling and \\npublishing and then a small runtime-only base image can be used to host the application. \\nRepository (repo): A collection of related Docker images, labeled with a tag that indicates the image \\nversion. Some repos contain multiple variants of a specific image, such as an image containing SDKs \\n(heavier), an image containing only runtimes (lighter), etc. Those variants can be marked with tags. A \\nsingle repo can contain platform variants, such as a Linux image and a Windows image. \\nRegistry: A service that provides access to repositories. The default registry for most public images is \\nDocker Hub (owned by Docker as an organization). A registry usually contains repositories from \\nmultiple teams. Companies often have private registries to store and manage images they’ve created. \\nAzure Container Registry is another example. \\nMulti-arch image: For multi-architecture, it’s a feature that simplifies the selection of the appropriate \\nimage, according to the platform where Docker is running. For example, when a Dock erfile requests a \\nbase image FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0 from the registry, it actually gets 6.0-\\nnanoserver-20H2, 6.0-nanoserver-1809 or 6.0-bullseye-slim, depending on the operating system \\nand version where Docker is running. \\nDocker Hub: A public registry to upload images and work with them. Docker Hub provides Docker \\nimage hosting, public or private registries, build triggers and web hooks, and integration with GitHub \\nand Bitbucket. \\nAzure Container Registry: A public resource for working with Docker images and its components in \\nAzure. This provides a registry that’s close to your deployments in Azure and that gives you control \\nover access, making it possible to use your Azure Active Directory groups and permissions.  \\nDocker Trusted Registry (DTR): A Docker registry service (from Docker) that can be installed on-\\npremises so it lives within the organization’s datacenter and network. It’s convenient for private \\nimages that should be managed within the enterprise. Docker Trusted Registry is included as  part of \\nthe Docker Datacenter product. \\nDocker Desktop: Development tools for Windows and macOS for building, running, and testing \\ncontainers locally. Docker Desktop for Windows provides development environments for both Linux \\nand Windows Containers. The Linux Docker host on Windows is based on a Hyper-V virtual machine. \\nThe host for Windows Containers is directly based on Windows. Docker Desktop for Mac is based on \\nthe Apple Hypervisor framework and the xhyve hypervisor, which provides a Linux Docker host virtual \\nmachine on macOS. Docker Desktop for Windows and for Mac replaces Docker Toolbox, which was \\nbased on Oracle VirtualBox. \\nCompose: A command-line tool and YAML file format with metadata for defining and running multi-\\ncontainer applications. You define a single application based on multiple images with one or more \\n.yml files that can override values depending on the environment. After you’ve cre ated the definitions,'),\n",

Containers are initially tested in a development environment or PC. \\nDevelopers should store images in a registry, which acts as a library of images and is needed when \\ndeploying to production orchestrators. Docker maintains a public registry via Docker Hub; other \\nvendors provide registries for different collections of images, including Azure Container Registry. \\nAlternatively, enterprises can have a private registry on-premises for their own Docker images. \\nFigure 2-4 shows how images and registries in Docker relate to other components.

However, there are fundamental differences between them, and which \\nframework you use will depend on what you want to accomplish. This section provides guidance on \\nwhen to choose each framework. \\nGeneral guidance \\nThis section provides a summary of when to choose .NET 6 or .NET Framework. We provide more \\ndetails about these choices in the sections that follow. \\nUse .NET 6, with Linux or Windows Containers, for your containerized Docker server application when:  \\n• You have cross-platform needs. For example, you want to use both Linux and Windows \\nContainers. \\n• Your application architecture is based on microservices. \\n• You need to start containers fast and want a small footprint per container to achieve better \\ndensity or more containers per hardware unit in order to lower your costs. \\nIn short, when you create new containerized .NET applications, you should consider  .NET 6 as the \\ndefault choice. It has many benefits and fits best with the containers philosophy and style of working.  \\nAn extra benefit of using .NET 6 is that you can run side-by-side .NET versions for applications within \\nthe same machine. This benefit is more important for servers or VMs that do not use containers, \\nbecause containers isolate the versions of .NET that the app needs. (As long as they are compatible \\nwith the underlying OS.) \\nUse .NET Framework for your containerized Docker server application when: \\n• Your application currently uses .NET Framework and has strong dependencies on Windows.'),\n",

When you deploy \\nand start a container, its image is far smaller with .NET 6 than with .NET Framework. In contrast, to use \\n.NET Framework for a container, you must base your image on the Windows Server Core image, which \\nis a lot heavier than the Windows Nano Server or Linux images that you use for .NET 6.  \\nAdditionally, .NET 6 is cross-platform, so you can deploy server apps with Linux or Windows container \\nimages. However, if you are using the traditional .NET Framework, you can only deploy images based \\non Windows Server Core. \\nThe following is a more detailed explanation of why to choose .NET 6. \\nDeveloping and deploying cross platform \\nClearly, if your goal is to have an application (web app or service) that can run on multiple platf orms \\nsupported by Docker (Linux and Windows), the right choice is .NET 6, because .NET Framework only \\nsupports Windows. \\n.NET 6 also supports macOS as a development platform. However, when you deploy containers to a \\nDocker host, that host must (currently) be based on Linux or Windows. For example, in a development \\nenvironment, you could use a Linux VM running on a Mac. \\nVisual Studio provides an integrated development environment (IDE) for Windows and supports \\nDocker development. \\nVisual Studio for Mac is an IDE, evolution of Xamarin Studio, that runs on macOS and supports \\nDocker-based application development. This tool should be the preferred choice for developers \\nworking in Mac machines who also want to use a powerful IDE. \\nYou can also use Visual Studio Code on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

You can also target .NET 6 with most third-party editors like Sublime, Emacs, vi, and the \\nopen-source OmniSharp project, which also provides IntelliSense support.  \\nIn addition to the IDEs and editors, you can use the .NET CLI for all supported platforms. \\nUsing containers for new (“green-field”) projects \\nContainers are commonly used in conjunction with a microservices architecture, although they can \\nalso be used to containerize web apps or services that follow any architectural pattern. You can use \\n.NET Framework on Windows Containers, but the modularity and lightweight nature of .NET 6 makes \\nit perfect for containers and microservices architectures. When you create and deploy a container, its \\nimage is far smaller with .NET 6 than with .NET Framework. \\nCreate and deploy microservices on containers \\nYou could use the traditional .NET Framework for building microservices-based applications (without \\ncontainers) by using plain processes. That way, because the .NET Framework is already installed and \\nshared across processes, processes are light and fast to start. However, if you are using containers, the \\nimage for the traditional .NET Framework is also based on Windows Server C ore and that makes it too \\nheavy for a microservices-on-containers approach. However, teams have been looking for \\nopportunities to improve the experience for .NET Framework users as well. Recently, size of the \\nWindows Server Core container images have been reduced to >40% smaller. \\nOn the other hand, .NET 6 is the best candidate if you’re embracing a microservices -oriented system \\nthat is based on containers because .NET 6 is lightweight. In addition, its related container images, for \\neither Linux or Windows Nano Server, are lean and small, making containers light and fast to start.  \\nA microservice is meant to be as small as possible: to be light when spinning up, to have a small \\nfootprint, to have a small Bounded Context (check DDD, Domain-Driven Design), to represent a small \\narea of concerns, and to be able to start and stop fast. For those requirements, you will want to use \\nsmall and fast-to-instantiate container images like the .NET 6 container image.  \\nA microservices architecture also allows you to mix technologies across a service boundary. This \\napproach enables a gradual migration to .NET 6 for new microservices that work in conjunction with \\nother microservices or with services developed with Node.js, Python, Java, GoLang, or other \\ntechnologies. \\nDeploying high density in scalable systems \\nWhen your container-based system needs the best possible density, granularity, and performance, \\n.NET and ASP.NET Core are your best options. ASP.NET Core is up to 10 times faster than ASP.NET in \\nthe traditional .NET Framework, and it leads to other popular industry technologies for microservices, \\nsuch as Java servlets, Go, and Node.js. \\nThis approach is especially relevant for microservices architectures, where you could have hundreds of \\nmicroservices (containers) running. With ASP.NET Core images (based on the .NET r untime) on Linux \\nor Windows Nano, you can run your system with a much lower number of servers or VMs, ultimately \\nsaving costs in infrastructure and hosting.'),\n",

However, a recommended \\napproach is to use .NET 6 as you extend an existing application, such as writing a new service in \\nASP.NET Core. \\nUsing third-party .NET libraries or NuGet packages not available for \\n.NET 6 \\nThird-party libraries are quickly embracing .NET Standard, which enables code sharing across all .NET \\nflavors, including .NET 6. With .NET Standard 2.0 and later, the API surface compatibility across \\ndifferent frameworks has become significantly larger. Even more, .NET Core 2.x and newer applications \\ncan also directly reference existing .NET Framework libraries (see .NET Framework 4.6.1 supporting \\n.NET Standard 2.0). \\nIn addition, the Windows Compatibility Pack extends the API surface available for .NET Standard 2.0 \\non Windows.

For those cases, you need to understand other architectural \\napproaches, such as the microservices and certain Domain-Driven Design (DDD) patterns plus \\ncontainer orchestration concepts. Note that this chapter describes not just microservices on \\ncontainers, but any containerized application, as well. \\nContainer design principles \\nIn the container model, a container image instance represents a single process. By defining a \\ncontainer image as a process boundary, you can create primitives that can be used to scale or batch \\nthe process. \\nWhen you design a container image, you’ll see an ENTRYPOINT definition in the Dockerfile. This \\ndefinition defines the process whose lifetime controls the lifetime of the container. When the process \\ncompletes, the container lifecycle ends. Containers might represent long-running processes like web \\nservers, but can also represent short-lived processes like batch jobs, which formerly might have been \\nimplemented as Azure WebJobs. \\nIf the process fails, the container ends, and the orchestrator takes over. If the orchestrator was \\nconfigured to keep five instances running and one fails, the orchestrator will create another container \\ninstance to replace the failed process. In a batch job, the process is started with parameters. When the \\nprocess completes, the work is complete. This guidance drills-down on orchestrators, later on.'),\n",

For th at \\nscenario, since there can be only one entry point per container, you could run a script within the \\ncontainer that launches as many programs as needed. For example, you can use Supervisor or a \\nsimilar tool to take care of launching multiple processes inside a single container. However, even \\nthough you can find architectures that hold multiple processes per container, that approach isn’t very \\ncommon. \\nContainerizing monolithic applications \\nYou might want to build a single, monolithically deployed web application or service and deploy it as \\na container. The application itself might not be internally monolithic, but structured as several \\nlibraries, components, or even layers (application layer, domain layer, data-access layer, etc.). \\nExternally, however, it’s a single container—a single process, a single web application, or a single \\nservice. \\nTo manage this model, you deploy a single container to represent the application. To increase \\ncapacity, you scale out, that is, just add more copies with a load balancer in front. The simplicity \\ncomes from managing a single deployment in a single container or VM. \\n \\nFigure 4-1. Example of the architecture of a containerized monolithic application \\nYou can include multiple components, libraries, or internal layers in each container, as illustrated in \\nFigure 4-1. A monolithic containerized application has most of its functionality within a single \\ncontainer, with internal layers or libraries, and scales out by cloning the container on multiple \\nservers/VMs. However, this monolithic pattern might conflict with the container principle “a container \\ndoes one thing, and does it in one process”, but might be ok for some cases. \\nThe downside of this approach becomes evident if the application grows, requiring it to scale. If the \\nentire application can scale, it isn’t really a problem. However, in most cases, just a few parts of the \\napplication are the choke points that require scaling, while other components are used less. \\nFor example, in a typical e-commerce application, you likely need to scale the product information \\nsubsystem, because many more customers browse products than purchase them.

If they’re managed with a container orchestrator, you should assume that they might get \\nmoved from one node or VM to another. \\nThe following solutions are used to manage data in Docker applications: \\nFrom the Docker host, as Docker Volumes: \\n• Volumes are stored in an area of the host filesystem that’s managed by Docker. \\n• Bind mounts can map to any folder in the host filesystem, so access can’t be controlled from \\nDocker process and can pose a security risk as a container could access sensitive OS folders. \\n• tmpfs mounts are like virtual folders that only exist in the host’s memory and are never written \\nto the filesystem. \\nFrom remote storage: \\n• Azure Storage, which provides geo-distributable storage, providing a good long-term \\npersistence solution for containers. \\n• Remote relational databases like Azure SQL Database or NoSQL databases like Azure Cosmos \\nDB, or cache services like Redis. \\nFrom the Docker container: \\n• Overlay File System. This Docker feature implements a copy-on-write task that stores updated \\ninformation to the root file system of the container. That information is “on top” of the original \\nimage on which the container is based. If the container is deleted from the system, those \\nchanges are lost. Therefore, while it’s possible to save the state of a container within its loca l \\nstorage, designing a system around this would conflict with the premise of container design, \\nwhich by default is stateless. \\nHowever, using Docker Volumes is now the preferred way to handle local data in Docker. If you need \\nmore information about storage in containers check on Docker storage drivers and About storage \\ndrivers. \\nThe following provides more detail about these options: \\nVolumes are directories mapped from the host OS to directories in containers. When code in the \\ncontainer has access to the directory, that access is actually to a directory on the host OS. This \\ndirectory is not tied to the lifetime of the container itself, and the directory is managed by Docker and \\nisolated from the core functionality of the host machine. Thus, data volumes are designed to persist \\ndata independently of the life of the container. If you delete a container or an image from the Docker \\nhost, the data persisted in the data volume isn’t deleted. \\nVolumes can be named or anonymous (the default). Named volumes are the evolution of Data \\nVolume Containers and make it easy to share data between containers. Volumes also support \\nvolume drivers that allow you to store data on remote hosts, among other options.  \\nBind mounts are available since a long time ago and allow the mapping of any folder to a mount \\npoint in a container.

That means a microservices architecture is mainly oriented to the  back-end, \\nalthough the approach is also being used for the front end. Each service runs in its own process and \\ncommunicates with other processes using protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS, WebSockets, or AMQP. \\nEach microservice implements a specific end-to-end domain or business capability within a certain \\ncontext boundary, and each must be developed autonomously and be deployable independently. \\nFinally, each microservice should own its related domain data model and domain logic (sovereignty'),\n",

When developing a microservice, size shouldn’t be the important \\npoint. Instead, the important point should be to create loosely coupled services so you have \\nautonomy of development, deployment, and scale, for each service. Of course, when identifying and \\ndesigning microservices, you should try to make them as small as possible as long as you don’t have \\ntoo many direct dependencies with other microservices. More important than the size of the \\nmicroservice is the internal cohesion it must have and its independence from other services.  \\nWhy a microservices architecture? In short, it provides long-term agility. Microservices enable better \\nmaintainability in complex, large, and highly-scalable systems by letting you create applications based \\non many independently deployable services that each have granular and autonomous lifecycles.  \\nAs an additional benefit, microservices can scale out independently. Instead of having a single \\nmonolithic application that you must scale out as a unit, you can instead scale out specific \\nmicroservices. That way, you can scale just the functional area that needs more processing power or \\nnetwork bandwidth to support demand, rather than scaling out other areas of the application that \\ndon’t need to be scaled. That means cost savings because you need less hardware.  \\n \\nFigure 4-6.

Each DDD Bounded \\nContext correlates to one business microservice (one or several services). This point about the \\nBounded Context pattern is expanded in the next section. \\nOn the other hand, the traditional (monolithic data) approach used in many applications is to have a \\nsingle centralized database or just a few databases.

But distributed data structures mean that you can’t make a single ACID transaction across \\nmicroservices. This in turn means you must use eventual consistency when a business process spans \\nmultiple microservices. This is much harder to implement than simple SQL joins, because you can’t \\ncreate integrity constraints or use distributed transactions between separate databases, as we’ll \\nexplain later on. Similarly, many other relational database features aren’t available across multiple \\nmicroservices. \\nGoing even further, different microservices often use different kinds of databases. Modern \\napplications store and process diverse kinds of data, and a relational database isn’t always the best \\nchoice. For some use cases, a NoSQL database such as Azure CosmosDB or MongoDB might have a \\nmore convenient data model and offer better performance and scalability than a SQL database like \\nSQL Server or Azure SQL Database.

These include \\nloosely coupled services and better performance, scalability, costs, and manageability. However, it can \\nintroduce some distributed data management challenges, as explained in “Identifying domain-model \\nboundaries” later in this chapter. \\nThe relationship between microservices and the Bounded Context \\npattern \\nThe concept of microservice derives from the Bounded Context (BC) pattern in domain-driven design \\n(DDD). DDD deals with large models by dividing them into multiple BCs and being explicit about their \\nboundaries. Each BC must have its own model and database; likewise, each microservice owns its \\nrelated data. In addition, each BC usually has its own ubiquitous language to help communication \\nbetween software developers and domain experts. \\nThose terms (mainly domain entities) in the ubiquitous language can have different names in different \\nBounded Contexts, even when different domain entities share the same identity (that is, the unique ID \\nthat’s used to read the entity from storage). For instance, in a user-profile Bounded Context, the User \\ndomain entity might share identity with the Buyer domain entity in the ordering Bounded Context.  \\nA microservice is therefore like a Bounded Context, but it also specifies that it’s a  distributed service. \\nIt’s built as a separate process for each Bounded Context, and it must use the distributed protocols \\nnoted earlier, like HTTP/HTTPS, WebSockets, or AMQP. The Bounded Context pattern, however, \\ndoesn’t specify whether the Bounded Context is a distributed service or if it’s si mply a logical \\nboundary (such as a generic subsystem) within a monolithic-deployment application. \\nIt’s important to highlight that defining a service for each Bounded Context is a good place to start. \\nBut you don’t have to constrain your design to it.

For instance, \\nDocker containers aren’t mandatory to create a microservice-based architecture. Those microservices \\ncould also be run as plain processes. Microservices is a logical architecture.  \\nMoreover, even when a microservice could be physically implemented as a single service, process, or \\ncontainer (for simplicity’s sake, that’s the approach taken in the initial version of eShopOnContainers), \\nthis parity between business microservice and physical service or container isn’t necessarily required in \\nall cases when you build a large and complex application composed of many dozens or even \\nhundreds of services. \\nThis is where there’s a difference between an application’s logical architecture and physical \\narchitecture. The logical architecture and logical boundaries of a system do not necessarily map one-\\nto-one to the physical or deployment architecture. It can happen, but it often doesn’t.  \\nAlthough you might have identified certain business microservices or Bounded Contexts, it doesn’t \\nmean that the best way to implement them is always by creating a single service (such as an ASP.NET \\nWeb API) or single Docker container for each business microservice. Having a rule saying each \\nbusiness microservice has to be implemented using a single service or container is too rigid.  \\nTherefore, a business microservice or Bounded Context is a logical architecture that might coincide (or \\nnot) with physical architecture. The important point is that a business microservice or Bounded \\nContext must be autonomous by allowing code and state to be independently versioned, deployed, \\nand scaled.'),\n",

Each microservice \\nhas to be a piece of your application and each microservice should be autonomous with all the \\nbenefits and challenges that it conveys. But how do you identify those boundaries? \\nFirst, you need to focus on the application’s logical domain models and related data. Try to identify \\ndecoupled islands of data and different contexts within the same application. Each context could have \\na different business language (different business terms). The contexts should be defined and managed \\nindependently. The terms and entities that are used in those different contexts might sound similar, \\nbut you might discover that in a particular context, a business concept with one is used for a different'),\n",

For instance, a user can be \\nreferred as a user in the identity or membership context, as a customer in a CRM context, as a buyer in \\nan ordering context, and so forth. \\nThe way you identify boundaries between multiple application contexts with a different domain for \\neach context is exactly how you can identify the boundaries for each business microservice and its \\nrelated domain model and data. You always attempt to minimize the coupling between those \\nmicroservices. This guide goes into more detail about this identification and domain model design in \\nthe section Identifying domain-model boundaries for each microservice later. \\nChallenge #2: How to create queries that retrieve data from several \\nmicroservices \\nA second challenge is how to implement queries that retrieve data from several microservices, while \\navoiding chatty communication to the microservices from remote client apps. An example could be a \\nsingle screen from a mobile app that needs to show user information that’s ow ned by the basket, \\ncatalog, and user identity microservices. Another example would be a complex report involving many \\ntables located in multiple microservices. The right solution depends on the complexity of the queries. \\nBut in any case, you’ll need a way to aggregate information if you want to improve the efficiency in \\nthe communications of your system. The most popular solutions are the following.  \\nAPI Gateway. For simple data aggregation from multiple microservices that own different databases, \\nthe recommended approach is an aggregation microservice referred to as an API Gateway. However, \\nyou need to be careful about implementing this pattern, because it can be a choke point in your \\nsystem, and it can violate the principle of microservice autonomy. To mitigate this possibility, you can \\nhave multiple fined-grained API Gateways each one focusing on a vertical “slice” or business area of \\nthe system. The API Gateway pattern is explained in more detail in the API Gateway section later. \\nCQRS with query/reads tables. Another solution for aggregating data from multiple microservices is \\nthe Materialized View pattern. In this approach, you generate, in advance (prepare denormalized data \\nbefore the actual queries happen), a read-only table with the data that’s owned by multiple \\nmicroservices. The table has a format suited to the client app’s needs. \\nConsider something like the screen for a mobile app. If you have a single database, you might pull \\ntogether the data for that screen using a SQL query that performs a complex join involving multiple \\ntables. However, when you have multiple databases, and each database is owned by a different \\nmicroservice, you cannot query those databases and create a SQL join. Your complex query becomes \\na challenge. You can address the requirement using a CQRS approach—you create a denormalized \\ntable in a different database that’s used just for queries. The table can be designed specifically for the \\ndata you need for the complex query, with a one-to-one relationship between fields needed by your \\napplication’s screen and the columns in the query table. It could also serve for reporting purposes.  \\nThis approach not only solves the original problem (how to query and join across microservices), but it \\nalso improves performance considerably when compared with a complex join, because you already \\nhave the data that the application needs in the query table. Of course, using Command and Query \\nResponsibility Segregation (CQRS) with query/reads tables means additional development work, and \\nyou’ll need to embrace eventual consistency. Nonetheless, requirements on performance and high'),\n",

For complex reports and queries that might not require real-time \\ndata, a common approach is to export your “hot data” (transactional data from the microservices) as \\n“cold data” into large databases that are used only for reporting. That central database system can be \\na Big Data-based system, like Hadoop, a data warehouse like one based on Azure SQL Data \\nWarehouse, or even a single SQL database that’s used just for reports (if size won’t be an issue).  \\nKeep in mind that this centralized database would be used only for queries and reports that do not \\nneed real-time data. The original updates and transactions, as your source of truth, have to be in your \\nmicroservices data. The way you would synchronize data would be either by using event -driven \\ncommunication (covered in the next sections) or by using other database infrastructure import/export \\ntools. If you use event-driven communication, that integration process would be similar to the way \\nyou propagate data as described earlier for CQRS query tables. \\nHowever, if your application design involves constantly aggregating information from multiple \\nmicroservices for complex queries, it might be a symptom of a bad design -a microservice should be \\nas isolated as possible from other microservices. (This excludes reports/analytics that always should \\nuse cold-data central databases.) Having this problem often might be a reason to merge \\nmicroservices. You need to balance the autonomy of evolution and deployment of each microservice \\nwith strong dependencies, cohesion, and data aggregation. \\nChallenge #3: How to achieve consistency across multiple \\nmicroservices \\nAs stated previously, the data owned by each microservice is private to that microservice and can only \\nbe accessed using its microservice API. Therefore, a challenge presented is how to implement end -to-\\nend business processes while keeping consistency across multiple microservices. \\nTo analyze this problem, let’s look at an example from the eShopOnContainers reference application. \\nThe Catalog microservice maintains information about all the products, including the product price. \\nThe Basket microservice manages temporal data about product items that users are adding to their \\nshopping baskets, which includes the price of the items at the time they were added to the basket. \\nWhen a product’s price is updated in the catalog, that price should also be updated in the active \\nbaskets that hold that same product, plus the system should probably warn the user saying that a \\nparticular item’s price has changed since they added it to their basket. \\nIn a hypothetical monolithic version of this application, when the price changes in the products table, \\nthe catalog subsystem could simply use an ACID transaction to update the current price in the  Basket \\ntable. \\nHowever, in a microservices-based application, the Product and Basket tables are owned by their \\nrespective microservices. No microservice should ever include tables/storage owned by another \\nmicroservice in its own transactions, not even in direct queries, as shown in Figure 4-9.'),\n",

A microservice can’t directly access a table in another microservice \\nThe Catalog microservice shouldn’t update the Basket table directly, because the Basket table is \\nowned by the Basket microservice. To make an update to the Basket microservice, the Catalog \\nmicroservice should use eventual consistency probably based on asynchronous communication such \\nas integration events (message and event-based communication). This is how the eShopOnContainers \\nreference application performs this type of consistency across microservices.  \\nAs stated by the CAP theorem, you need to choose between availability and ACID strong consistency. \\nMost microservice-based scenarios demand availability and high scalability as opposed to strong \\nconsistency. Mission-critical applications must remain up and running, and developers can work \\naround strong consistency by using techniques for working with weak or eventual consistency. This is \\nthe approach taken by most microservice-based architectures. \\nMoreover, ACID-style or two-phase commit transactions are not just against microservices principles; \\nmost NoSQL databases (like Azure Cosmos DB, MongoDB, etc.) do not support two-phase commit \\ntransactions, typical in distributed databases scenarios. However, maintaining data consistency across \\nservices and databases is essential. This challenge is also related to the question of how to propagate \\nchanges across multiple microservices when certain data needs to be redundant—for example, when \\nyou need to have the product’s name or description in the Catalog microservice and the Basket \\nmicroservice. \\nA good solution for this problem is to use eventual consistency between microservices articulated \\nthrough event-driven communication and a publish-and-subscribe system.

In this context, communic ation \\ndoesn’t refer to what protocol you should use (HTTP and REST, AMQP, messaging, and so on). Instead, \\nit addresses what communication style you should use, and especially how coupled your \\nmicroservices should be. Depending on the level of coupling, when failure occurs, the impact of that \\nfailure on your system will vary significantly. \\nIn a distributed system like a microservices-based application, with so many artifacts moving around \\nand with distributed services across many servers or hosts, components will eventually fail. Partial \\nfailure and even larger outages will occur, so you need to design your microservices and the \\ncommunication across them considering the common risks in this type of distributed system.  \\nA popular approach is to implement HTTP (REST)-based microservices, due to their simplicity. An \\nHTTP-based approach is perfectly acceptable; the issue here is related to how you use it. If you use \\nHTTP requests and responses just to interact with your microservices from client applications or fro m \\nAPI Gateways, that’s fine. But if you create long chains of synchronous HTTP calls across microservices, \\ncommunicating across their boundaries as if the microservices were objects in a monolithic \\napplication, your application will eventually run into problems. \\nFor instance, imagine that your client application makes an HTTP API call to an individual microservice \\nlike the Ordering microservice. If the Ordering microservice in turn calls additional microservices using \\nHTTP within the same request/response cycle, you’re creating a chain of HTTP calls. It might sound \\nreasonable initially. However, there are important points to consider when going down this path:  \\n• Blocking and low performance. Due to the synchronous nature of HTTP, the original  request \\ndoesn’t get a response until all the internal HTTP calls are finished. Imagine if the number of \\nthese calls increases significantly and at the same time one of the intermediate HTTP calls to a \\nmicroservice is blocked. The result is that performance is impacted, and the overall scalability will \\nbe exponentially affected as additional HTTP requests increase. \\n• Coupling microservices with HTTP. Business microservices shouldn’t be coupled with other \\nbusiness microservices. Ideally, they shouldn’t “know” about the existence of other microservices. \\nIf your application relies on coupling microservices as in the example, achieving autonomy per \\nmicroservice will be almost impossible. \\n• Failure in any one microservice. If you implemented a chain of microservices linked by HTTP \\ncalls, when any of the microservices fails (and eventually they will fail) the whole chain of \\nmicroservices will fail. A microservice-based system should be designed to continue to work as \\nwell as possible during partial failures. Even if you implement client logic that uses retries with \\nexponential backoff or circuit breaker mechanisms, the more complex the HTTP call chains are, \\nthe more complex it is to implement a failure strategy based on HTTP. \\nIn fact, if your internal microservices are communicating by creating chains of HTTP requests as \\ndescribed, it could be argued that you have a monolithic application, but one based on HTTP between \\nprocesses instead of intra-process communication mechanisms.'),\n",

Sometimes, a BC could be composed of several \\nphysical services, but not vice versa. \\nA domain model with specific domain entities applies within a concrete BC or microservice. A BC \\ndelimits the applicability of a domain model and gives developer team members a clear and shared \\nunderstanding of what must be cohesive and what can be developed independently. These are the \\nsame goals for microservices. \\nAnother tool that informs your design choice is Conway’s law, which states that an application will \\nreflect the social boundaries of the organization that produced it. But sometimes the opposite is true -\\nthe company’s organization is formed by the software. You might need to reverse Conway’s law and \\nbuild the boundaries the way you want the company to be organized, leaning toward business \\nprocess consulting. \\nTo identify bounded contexts, you can use a DDD pattern called the Context Mapping pattern. With \\nContext Mapping, you identify the various contexts in the application and their boundaries. It’s \\ncommon to have a different context and boundary for each small subsystem, for instance. The Context \\nMap is a way to define and make explicit those boundaries between domains. A BC is autonomous \\nand includes the details of a single domain -details like the domain entities- and defines integration \\ncontracts with other BCs. This is similar to the definition of a microservice: it’s autonomous, it \\nimplements certain domain capability, and it must provide interfaces. This is why Context Mapp ing \\nand the Bounded Context pattern are good approaches for identifying the domain model boundaries \\nof your microservices. \\nWhen designing a large application, you’ll see how its domain model can be fragmented - a domain \\nexpert from the catalog domain will name entities differently in the catalog and inventory domains \\nthan a shipping domain expert, for instance. Or the user domain entity might be different in size and \\nnumber of attributes when dealing with a CRM expert who wants to store every detail about t he \\ncustomer than for an ordering domain expert who just needs partial data about the customer. It’s very \\nhard to disambiguate all domain terms across all the domains related to a large application. But the \\nmost important thing is that you shouldn’t try to unify the terms. Instead, accept the differences and \\nrichness provided by each domain. If you try to have a unified database for the whole application, \\nattempts at a unified vocabulary will be awkward and won’t sound right to any of the multiple domain \\nexperts. Therefore, BCs (implemented as microservices) will help you to clarify where you can use \\ncertain domain terms and where you’ll need to split the system and create additional BCs with \\ndifferent domains. \\nYou’ll know that you got the right boundaries and sizes of each BC and domain model if you have few \\nstrong relationships between domain models, and you do not usually need to merge information \\nfrom multiple domain models when performing typical application operations.  \\nPerhaps the best answer to the question of how large a domain model for each microservice should \\nbe is the following: it should have an autonomous BC, as isolated as possible, that enables you to \\nwork without having to constantly switch to other contexts (other microservice’s m odels). In Figure 4-\\n10, you can see how multiple microservices (multiple BCs) each has their own model and how their'),\n",

Therefore, there needs to be a way to map a user entity from one domain \\n(microservice) to another. \\nThere are several benefits to not sharing the same user entity with the same number of attributes \\nacross domains.

In this \\napproach, a client app can make requests directly to some of the microservices, as shown in Figure 4 -\\n12. \\n \\nFigure 4-12. Using a direct client-to-microservice communication architecture \\nIn this approach, each microservice has a public endpoint, sometimes with a different TCP port for \\neach microservice. An example of a URL for a particular service could be the following URL in Azure:  \\nhttp://eshoponcontainers.westus.cloudapp.azure.com:88/ \\nIn a production environment based on a cluster, that URL would map to the load balancer used in the \\ncluster, which in turn distributes the requests across the microservices. In production environments, \\nyou could have an Application Delivery Controller (ADC) like Azure Application Gateway between your \\nmicroservices and the Internet.

This approach increases latency and complexity on the UI side. Ideally, responses \\nshould be efficiently aggregated in the server side. This approach reduces latency, since multiple \\npieces of data come back in parallel and some UI can show data as soon as it’s ready. \\n• How can you handle cross-cutting concerns such as authorization, data transformations, and \\ndynamic request dispatching? \\nImplementing security and cross-cutting concerns like security and authorization on every \\nmicroservice can require significant development effort. A possible approach is to have those services \\nwithin the Docker host or internal cluster to restrict direct access to them from the outside, and to \\nimplement those cross-cutting concerns in a centralized place, like an API Gateway. \\n• How can client apps communicate with services that use non-Internet-friendly protocols? \\nProtocols used on the server side (like AMQP or binary protocols) are not supported in client apps. \\nTherefore, requests must be performed through protocols like HTTP/HTTPS and translated to the \\nother protocols afterwards. A man-in-the-middle approach can help in this situation. \\n• How can you shape a facade especially made for mobile apps? \\nThe API of multiple microservices might not be well designed for the needs of different client \\napplications. For instance, the needs of a mobile app might be different than the needs of a web app. \\nFor mobile apps, you might need to optimize even further so that data responses can be m ore \\nefficient. You might do this functionality by aggregating data from multiple microservices and \\nreturning a single set of data, and sometimes eliminating any data in the response that isn’t needed \\nby the mobile app. And, of course, you might compress that data. Again, a facade or API in between \\nthe mobile app and the microservices can be convenient for this scenario. \\nWhy consider API Gateways instead of direct client-to-microservice \\ncommunication \\nIn a microservices architecture, the client apps usually need to consume functionality from more than \\none microservice. If that consumption is performed directly, the client needs to handle multiple calls \\nto microservice endpoints. What happens when the application evolves and new microservices are \\nintroduced or existing microservices are updated? If your application has many microservices, \\nhandling so many endpoints from the client apps can be a nightmare.

Client apps need to be \\nupdated frequently, making the solution harder to evolve. \\n• Too many round trips: A single page/screen in the client app might require several calls to \\nmultiple services. That approach can result in multiple network round trips between the client \\nand the server, adding significant latency. Aggregation handled in an intermediate level could \\nimprove the performance and user experience for the client app. \\n• Security issues: Without a gateway, all the microservices must be exposed to the “external \\nworld”, making the attack surface larger than if you hide internal microservices that aren’t \\ndirectly used by the client apps. The smaller the attack surface is, the more secure your \\napplication can be. \\n• Cross-cutting concerns: Each publicly published microservice must handle concerns such as \\nauthorization and SSL. In many situations, those concerns could be handled in a single tier so the \\ninternal microservices are simplified. \\nWhat is the API Gateway pattern? \\nWhen you design and build large or complex microservice-based applications with multiple client \\napps, a good approach to consider can be an API Gateway. This pattern is a service that provides a \\nsingle-entry point for certain groups of microservices. It’s similar to the Facade pattern from object-\\noriented design, but in this case, it’s part of a distributed system. The API Gateway pattern is also \\nsometimes known as the “backend for frontend” (BFF) because you build it while thinking about the \\nneeds of the client app. \\nTherefore, the API gateway sits between the client apps and the microservices. It acts as a reverse \\nproxy, routing requests from clients to services. It can also provide other cross-cutting features such \\nas authentication, SSL termination, and cache. \\nFigure 4-13 shows how a custom API Gateway can fit into a simplified microservice-based architecture \\nwith just a few microservices.'),\n",

Using an API Gateway implemented as a custom service \\nApps connect to a single endpoint, the API Gateway, that’s configured to forward requests to \\nindividual microservices. In this example, the API Gateway would be implemented as a custom \\nASP.NET Core WebHost service running as a container. \\nIt’s important to highlight that in that diagram, you would be using a single custom API Gateway \\nservice facing multiple and different client apps. That fact can be an important risk because your API \\nGateway service will be growing and evolving based on many different requirements from the client \\napps. Eventually, it will be bloated because of those different needs and effectively it could be similar \\nto a monolithic application or monolithic service. That’s why it’s very much recommended to split the \\nAPI Gateway in multiple services or multiple smaller API Gateways, one per client app form -factor \\ntype, for instance. \\nYou need to be careful when implementing the API Gateway pattern. Usually it isn’t a good idea to \\nhave a single API Gateway aggregating all the internal microservices of your application. If it does, it \\nacts as a monolithic aggregator or orchestrator and violates microservice autonomy by coupling all \\nthe microservices. \\nTherefore, the API Gateways should be segregated based on business boundaries and the client apps \\nand not act as a single aggregator for all the internal microservices. \\nWhen splitting the API Gateway tier into multiple API Gateways, if your application has multiple client \\napps, that can be a primary pivot when identifying the multiple API Gateways types, so that you can \\nhave a different facade for the needs of each client app. This case is a pattern named “Backend for \\nFrontend” (BFF) where each API Gateway can provide a different API tailored for each client app type, \\npossibly even based on the client form factor by implementing specific adapter code which \\nunderneath calls multiple internal microservices, as shown in the following image:'),\n",

In \\nthis case, the boundaries identified for each API Gateway are based purely on the “Backend for \\nFrontend” (BFF) pattern, hence based just on the API needed per client app. But in larger applications \\nyou should also go further and create other API Gateways based on business boundaries as a second \\ndesign pivot. \\nMain features in the API Gateway pattern \\nAn API Gateway can offer multiple features. Depending on the product it might offer richer or simpler \\nfeatures, however, the most important and foundational features for any API Gateway are the \\nfollowing design patterns: \\nReverse proxy or gateway routing. The API Gateway offers a reverse proxy to redirect or route \\nrequests (layer 7 routing, usually HTTP requests) to the endpoints of the internal microservices. The \\ngateway provides a single endpoint or URL for the client apps and then internally maps the requests \\nto a group of internal microservices. This routing feature helps to decouple the client apps from the \\nmicroservices but it’s also convenient when modernizing a monolithic API by sitting the API Gateway \\nin between the monolithic API and the client apps, then you can add new APIs as new microservices \\nwhile still using the legacy monolithic API until it’s split into many microservices in the future. Because \\nof the API Gateway, the client apps won’t notice if the APIs being used are implemented as internal \\nmicroservices or a monolithic API and more importantly, when evolving and refactoring the \\nmonolithic API into microservices, thanks to the API Gateway routing, client apps won’t be impacted \\nwith any URI change.'),\n",

As part of the gateway pattern you can aggregate multiple client requests \\n(usually HTTP requests) targeting multiple internal microservices into a single client request. This \\npattern is especially convenient when a client page/screen needs information from several \\nmicroservices. With this approach, the client app sends a single request to the API Gateway that \\ndispatches several requests to the internal microservices and then aggregates the results and sends \\neverything back to the client app. The main benefit and goal of this design pattern is to reduce \\nchattiness between the client apps and the backend API, which is especially important for remote \\napps out of the datacenter where the microservices live, like mobile apps or requests coming from \\nSPA apps that come from JavaScript in client remote browsers. For regular web apps performing the \\nrequests in the server environment (like an ASP.NET Core MVC web app), this pattern is not so \\nimportant as the latency is very much smaller than for remote client apps. \\nDepending on the API Gateway product you use, it might be able to perform this aggregation. \\nHowever, in many cases it’s more flexible to create aggregation microservices under the scope of the \\nAPI Gateway, so you define the aggregation in code (that is, C# code): \\nFor more information, see Gateway aggregation pattern. \\nCross-cutting concerns or gateway offloading. Depending on the features offered by each API \\nGateway product, you can offload functionality from individual microservices to the gateway, which \\nsimplifies the implementation of each microservice by consolidating cross-cutting concerns into one \\ntier.

Each service instance is typically a process. Therefore, \\nservices must interact using an inter-process communication protocol such as HTTP, AMQP, or a \\nbinary protocol like TCP, depending on the nature of each service. \\nThe microservice community promotes the philosophy of “smart endpoints and dumb pipes” This \\nslogan encourages a design that’s as decoupled as possible between microservices, and as cohesive \\nas possible within a single microservice. As explained earlier, each microservice owns its own data and \\nits own domain logic. But the microservices composing an end-to-end application are usually simply \\nchoreographed by using REST communications rather than complex protocols such as WS -* and \\nflexible event-driven communications instead of centralized business-process-orchestrators. \\nThe two commonly used protocols are HTTP request/response with resource APIs (when querying \\nmost of all), and lightweight asynchronous messaging when communicating updates across multiple \\nmicroservices. These are explained in more detail in the following sections. \\nCommunication types \\nClient and services can communicate through many different types of communication, each one \\ntargeting a different scenario and goals. Initially, those types of communications can be classified in \\ntwo axes. \\nThe first axis defines if the protocol is synchronous or asynchronous: \\n• Synchronous protocol. HTTP is a synchronous protocol. The client sends a request and waits for \\na response from the service. That’s independent of the client code execution that could be  \\nsynchronous (thread is blocked) or asynchronous (thread isn’t blocked, and the response will \\nreach a callback eventually). The important point here is that the protocol (HTTP/HTTPS) is \\nsynchronous and the client code can only continue its task when it receives the HTTP server \\nresponse. \\n• Asynchronous protocol. Other protocols like AMQP (a protocol supported by many operating \\nsystems and cloud environments) use asynchronous messages. The client code or message \\nsender usually doesn’t wait for a response. It just sends the message as when sending a message \\nto a RabbitMQ queue or any other message broker. \\nThe second axis defines if the communication has a single receiver or multiple receivers:  \\n• Single receiver. Each request must be processed by exactly one receiver or service. An example \\nof this communication is the Command pattern. \\n• Multiple receivers. Each request can be processed by zero to multiple receivers. This type of \\ncommunication must be asynchronous. An example is the publish/subscribe mechanism used in \\npatterns like Event-driven architecture. This is based on an event-bus interface or message \\nbroker when propagating data updates between multiple microservices through events; it’s \\nusually implemented through a service bus or similar artifact like Azure Service Bus by using \\ntopics and subscriptions.'),\n",

The \\nmost common type is single-receiver communication with a synchronous protocol like HTTP/HTTPS \\nwhen invoking a regular Web API HTTP service. Microservices also typically use messaging protocols \\nfor asynchronous communication between microservices. \\nThese axes are good to know so you have clarity on the possible communication mechanisms, but \\nthey’re not the important concerns when building microservices. Neither the asynchronous nature of  \\nclient thread execution nor the asynchronous nature of the selected protocol are the important points \\nwhen integrating microservices. What is important is being able to integrate your microservices \\nasynchronously while maintaining the independence of microservices, as explained in the following \\nsection. \\nAsynchronous microservice integration enforces microservice’s \\nautonomy \\nAs mentioned, the important point when building a microservices-based application is the way you \\nintegrate your microservices. Ideally, you should try to minimize the communication between the \\ninternal microservices. The fewer communications between microservices, the better. But in many \\ncases, you’ll have to somehow integrate the microservices. When you need to do that, the critical rule  \\nhere is that the communication between the microservices should be asynchronous. That doesn’t \\nmean that you have to use a specific protocol (for example, asynchronous messaging versus \\nsynchronous HTTP). It just means that the communication between microservices should be done only \\nby propagating data asynchronously, but try not to depend on other internal microservices as part of \\nthe initial service’s HTTP request/response operation. \\nIf possible, never depend on synchronous communication (request/response) between multiple \\nmicroservices, not even for queries. The goal of each microservice is to be autonomous and available \\nto the client consumer, even if the other services that are part of the end-to-end application are down \\nor unhealthy. If you think you need to make a call from one microservice to other microservices (like \\nperforming an HTTP request for a data query) to be able to provide a response to a client application, \\nyou have an architecture that won’t be resilient when some microservices fail.  \\nMoreover, having HTTP dependencies between microservices, like when creating long \\nrequest/response cycles with HTTP request chains, as shown in the first part of the Figure 4 -15, not \\nonly makes your microservices not autonomous but also their performance is impacted as soon as \\none of the services in that chain isn’t performing well. \\nThe more you add synchronous dependencies between microservices, such as query requests, the \\nworse the overall response time gets for the client apps.'),\n",

Anti-patterns and patterns in communication between microservices \\nAs shown in the above diagram, in synchronous communication a “chain” of requests is created \\nbetween microservices while serving the client request. This is an anti-pattern. In asynchronous \\ncommunication microservices use asynchronous messages or http polling to communicate with other \\nmicroservices, but the client request is served right away. \\nIf your microservice needs to raise an additional action in another microservice, if possible, do not \\nperform that action synchronously and as part of the original microservice request and reply \\noperation. Instead, do it asynchronously (using asynchronous messaging or integration events, \\nqueues, etc.). But, as much as possible, do not invoke the action synchronously as part of the original \\nsynchronous request and reply operation. \\nAnd finally (and this is where most of the issues arise when building microservices), if your initial \\nmicroservice needs data that’s originally owned by other microservices, do not rely on making \\nsynchronous requests for that data. Instead, replicate or propagate that data (only the attributes you \\nneed) into the initial service’s database by using eventual consistency (typically by using integration \\nevents, as explained in upcoming sections). \\nAs noted earlier in the Identifying domain-model boundaries for each microservice section, \\nduplicating some data across several microservices isn’t an incorrect design—on the contrary, when \\ndoing that you can translate the data into the specific language or terms of that additional domain or \\nBounded Context. For instance, in the eShopOnContainers application you have a microservice named \\nidentity-api that’s in charge of most of the user’s data with an entity named User. However, when \\nyou need to store data about the user within the Ordering microservice, you store it as a different \\nentity named Buyer.

As mentioned, you could use integration events using an event \\nbus or message broker or you could even use HTTP by polling the other services instead. It doesn’t \\nmatter. The important rule is to not create synchronous dependencies between your micro services. \\nThe following sections explain the multiple communication styles you can consider using in a \\nmicroservice-based application. \\nCommunication styles \\nThere are many protocols and choices you can use for communication, depending on the \\ncommunication type you want to use. If you’re using a synchronous request/response-based \\ncommunication mechanism, protocols such as HTTP and REST approaches are the most common, \\nespecially if you’re publishing your services outside the Docker host or microservice cluster . If you’re \\ncommunicating between services internally (within your Docker host or microservices cluster), you \\nmight also want to use binary format communication mechanisms (like WCF using TCP and binary \\nformat). Alternatively, you can use asynchronous, message-based communication mechanisms such as \\nAMQP. \\nThere are also multiple message formats like JSON or XML, or even binary formats, which can be more \\nefficient. If your chosen binary format isn’t a standard, it’s probably not a good idea to publicly \\npublish your services using that format. You could use a non-standard format for internal \\ncommunication between your microservices. You might do this when communicating between \\nmicroservices within your Docker host or microservice cluster (for example, Docker or chestrators), or \\nfor proprietary client applications that talk to the microservices. \\nRequest/response communication with HTTP and REST \\nWhen a client uses request/response communication, it sends a request to a service, then the service \\nprocesses the request and sends back a response. Request/response communication is especially well \\nsuited for querying data for a real-time UI (a live user interface) from client apps.

One-to-many real-time asynchronous message communication \\nSignalR is a good way to achieve real-time communication for pushing content to the clients from a \\nback-end server. Since communication is in real time, client apps show the changes almost instantly. \\nThis is usually handled by a protocol such as WebSockets, using many WebSockets connections (one \\nper client). A typical example is when a service communicates a change in the score of a sports game \\nto many client web apps simultaneously. \\nAsynchronous message-based communication \\nAsynchronous messaging and event-driven communication are critical when propagating changes \\nacross multiple microservices and their related domain models. As mentioned earlier in the discussion \\nmicroservices and Bounded Contexts (BCs), models (User, Customer, Product, Account, etc.) can mean \\ndifferent things to different microservices or BCs. That means that when changes occur, you need \\nsome way to reconcile changes across the different models. A solution is eventual consistency and \\nevent-driven communication based on asynchronous messaging. \\nWhen using messaging, processes communicate by exchanging messages asynchronously. A client \\nmakes a command or a request to a service by sending it a message. If the service needs to reply, it \\nsends a different message back to the client. Since it’s a message-based communication, the client \\nassumes that the reply won’t be received immediately, and that there might be no response at all.  \\nA message is composed by a header (metadata such as identification or security infor mation) and a \\nbody. Messages are usually sent through asynchronous protocols like AMQP. \\nThe preferred infrastructure for this type of communication in the microservices community is a \\nlightweight message broker, which is different than the large brokers and orchestrators used in SOA. \\nIn a lightweight message broker, the infrastructure is typically “dumb,” acting only as a message \\nbroker, with simple implementations such as RabbitMQ or a scalable service bus in the cloud like'),\n",

In this scenario, most of the “smart” thinking still lives in the endpoints that are \\nproducing and consuming messages-that is, in the microservices. \\nAnother rule you should try to follow, as much as possible, is to use only asynchronous messaging \\nbetween the internal services, and to use synchronous communication (such as HTTP) only from the \\nclient apps to the front-end services (API Gateways plus the first level of microservices). \\nThere are two kinds of asynchronous messaging communication: single receiver message -based \\ncommunication, and multiple receivers message-based communication. The following sections \\nprovide details about them. \\nSingle-receiver message-based communication \\nMessage-based asynchronous communication with a single receiver means there’s point -to-point \\ncommunication that delivers a message to exactly one of the consumers that’s reading from the \\nchannel, and that the message is processed just once. However, there are special situations. For \\ninstance, in a cloud system that tries to automatically recover from failures, the same message could \\nbe sent multiple times. Due to network or other failures, the client has to be able to retry sending \\nmessages, and the server has to implement an operation to be idempotent in order to process a \\nparticular message just once. \\nSingle-receiver message-based communication is especially well suited for sending asynchronous \\ncommands from one microservice to another as shown in Figure 4-18 that illustrates this approach. \\nOnce you start sending message-based communication (either with commands or events), you should \\navoid mixing message-based communication with synchronous HTTP communication. \\n \\nFigure 4-18.

Use message-based commands when you need higher scalability or when you’re already \\nin a message-based business process. \\nMultiple-receivers message-based communication \\nAs a more flexible approach, you might also want to use a publish/subscribe mechanism so that your \\ncommunication from the sender will be available to additional subscriber microservices or to external \\napplications. Thus, it helps you to follow the open/closed principle in the sending service. That way, \\nadditional subscribers can be added in the future without the need to modify the sender service. \\nWhen you use a publish/subscribe communication, you might be using an event bus interface to \\npublish events to any subscriber. \\nAsynchronous event-driven communication \\nWhen using asynchronous event-driven communication, a microservice publishes an integration event \\nwhen something happens within its domain and another microservice needs to be aware of it, like a \\nprice change in a product catalog microservice. Additional microservices subscribe to the events so \\nthey can receive them asynchronously. When that happens, the receivers might update their own \\ndomain entities, which can cause more integration events to be published. This publish/subscribe \\nsystem is performed by using an implementation of an event bus. The event bus ca n be designed as \\nan abstraction or interface, with the API that’s needed to subscribe or unsubscribe to events and to \\npublish events. The event bus can also have one or more implementations based on any inter -process \\nand messaging broker, like a messaging queue or service bus that supports asynchronous \\ncommunication and a publish/subscribe model. \\nIf a system uses eventual consistency driven by integration events, it’s recommended that this \\napproach is made clear to the end user. The system shouldn’t use an approach that mimics \\nintegration events, like SignalR or polling systems from the client. The end user and the business \\nowner have to explicitly embrace eventual consistency in the system and realize that in many cases \\nthe business doesn’t have any problem with this approach, as long as it’s explicit. This approach is \\nimportant because users might expect to see some results immediately and this aspect might not \\nhappen with eventual consistency. \\nAs noted earlier in the Challenges and solutions for distributed data management section, you can use \\nintegration events to implement business tasks that span multiple microservices. Thus, you’ll have \\neventual consistency between those services. An eventually consistent transaction is made up of a \\ncollection of distributed actions. At each action, the related microservice updates a domain entity and \\npublishes another integration event that raises the next action within the same end-to-end business \\ntask. \\nAn important point is that you might want to communicate to multiple microservices that are \\nsubscribed to the same event. To do so, you can use publish/subscribe messaging based on event-\\ndriven communication, as shown in Figure 4-19.

You’ll be able to evolve a \\nmicroservice independently only if you do not break its API contract, which is why the contract is so \\nimportant. If you change the contract, it will impact your client applications or your API Gatewa y. \\nThe nature of the API definition depends on which protocol you’re using. For instance, if you’re using \\nmessaging (like AMQP), the API consists of the message types. If you’re using HTTP and RESTful \\nservices, the API consists of the URLs and the request and response JSON formats.  \\nHowever, even if you’re thoughtful about your initial contract, a service API will need to change ov er \\ntime. When that happens—and especially if your API is a public API consumed by multiple client \\napplications — you typically can’t force all clients to upgrade to your new API contract. You usually \\nneed to incrementally deploy new versions of a service in a way that both old and new versions of a \\nservice contract are running simultaneously. Therefore, it’s important to have a strategy for your \\nservice versioning. \\nWhen the API changes are small, like if you add attributes or parameters to your API, clients  that use \\nan older API should switch and work with the new version of the service. You might be able to provide \\ndefault values for any missing attributes that are required, and the clients might be able to ignore any \\nextra response attributes. \\nHowever, sometimes you need to make major and incompatible changes to a service API. Because \\nyou might not be able to force client applications or services to upgrade immediately to the new \\nversion, a service must support older versions of the API for some period. If you’re using an HTTP-\\nbased mechanism such as REST, one approach is to embed the API version number in the URL or into \\nan HTTP header. Then you can decide between implementing both versions of the service \\nsimultaneously within the same service instance, or deploying different instances that each handle a \\nversion of the API. A good approach for this functionality is the Mediator pattern (for example, \\nMediatR library) to decouple the different implementation versions into independent handlers.  \\nFinally, if you’re using a REST architecture, Hypermedia is the best solution for versioning your services \\nand allowing evolvable APIs. \\nAdditional resources \\n• Scott Hanselman.

Your microservice needs \\nto be addressable wherever it’s running. If you have to think about which computer is running a \\nparticular microservice, things can go bad quickly. In the same way that DNS resolves a URL to a \\nparticular computer, your microservice needs to have a unique name so that its current location is \\ndiscoverable. Microservices need addressable names that make them independent from the \\ninfrastructure that they’re running on. This approach implies that there’s an interaction between how \\nyour service is deployed and how it’s discovered, because there needs to be a service registry. In the \\nsame vein, when a computer fails, the registry service must be able to indicate where the service is \\nnow running. \\nThe service registry pattern is a key part of service discovery. The registry is a database containing the \\nnetwork locations of service instances. A service registry needs to be highly available and up -to-date. \\nClients could cache network locations obtained from the service registry. However, that information \\neventually goes out of date and clients can no longer discover service instances. So, a service registry \\nconsists of a cluster of servers that use a replication protocol to maintain consistency.  \\nIn some microservice deployment environments (called clusters, to be covered in a later section), \\nservice discovery is built in. For example, an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) environment can handle \\nservice instance registration and deregistration.

Much of the code that developers write involves handling exceptions, and this is also where \\nthe most time is spent in testing. The problem is more involved than writing code to handle failures. \\nWhat happens when the machine where the microservice is running fails? Not only do you need to \\ndetect this microservice failure (a hard problem on its own), but you also need something to restart \\nyour microservice. \\nA microservice needs to be resilient to failures and to be able to restart often on  another machine for \\navailability. This resiliency also comes down to the state that was saved on behalf of the microservice, \\nwhere the microservice can recover this state from, and whether the microservice can restart \\nsuccessfully. In other words, there needs to be resiliency in the compute capability (the process can \\nrestart at any time) as well as resilience in the state or data (no data loss, and the data remains \\nconsistent). \\nThe problems of resiliency are compounded during other scenarios, such as when  failures occur \\nduring an application upgrade. The microservice, working with the deployment system, needs to \\ndetermine whether it can continue to move forward to the newer version or instead roll back to a \\nprevious version to maintain a consistent state. Questions such as whether enough machines are \\navailable to keep moving forward and how to recover previous versions of the microservice need to \\nbe considered. This approach requires the microservice to emit health information so that the overall \\napplication and orchestrator can make these decisions. \\nIn addition, resiliency is related to how cloud-based systems must behave. As mentioned, a cloud-\\nbased system must embrace failures and must try to automatically recover from them. For instance, in \\ncase of network or container failures, client apps or client services must have a strategy to retry \\nsending messages or to retry requests, since in many cases failures in the cloud are partial. The \\nImplementing Resilient Applications section in this guide addresses how to handle partial failure. It \\ndescribes techniques like retries with exponential backoff or the Circuit Breaker patter n in .NET by \\nusing libraries like Polly, which offers a large variety of policies to handle this subject. \\nHealth management and diagnostics in microservices \\nIt may seem obvious, and it’s often overlooked, but a microservice must report its health and \\ndiagnostics.

In the same way that you interact with a microservice over agreed -\\nupon protocols and data formats, there’s a need for standardization in how to log health and \\ndiagnostic events that ultimately end up in an event store for querying and viewing. In a microservices \\napproach, it’s key that different teams agree on a single logging format. There needs to be a \\nconsistent approach to viewing diagnostic events in the application. \\nHealth checks \\nHealth is different from diagnostics. Health is about the microservice reporting its current state to take \\nappropriate actions. A good example is working with upgrade and deployment mechanisms to \\nmaintain availability. Although a service might currently be unhealthy due to a process crash or \\nmachine reboot, the service might still be operational. The last thing you need is to make this worse \\nby performing an upgrade. The best approach is to do an investigation first or allow time for the \\nmicroservice to recover. Health events from a microservice help us make informed decisions and, in \\neffect, help create self-healing services. \\nIn the Implementing health checks in ASP.NET Core services section of this guide, we explain how to \\nuse a new ASP.NET HealthChecks library in your microservices so they can report  their state to a \\nmonitoring service to take appropriate actions. \\nYou also have the option of using an excellent open-source library called \\nAspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks, available on GitHub and as a NuGet package. This library also \\ndoes health checks, with a twist, it handles two types of checks: \\n• Liveness: Checks if the microservice is alive, that is, if it’s able to accept requests and respond.  \\n• Readiness: Checks if the microservice’s dependencies (Database, queue services, etc.) are \\nthemselves ready, so the microservice can do what it’s supposed to do.  \\nUsing diagnostics and logs event streams \\nLogs provide information about how an application or service is running, including exceptions, \\nwarnings, and simple informational messages. Usually, each log is in a text format with one line per \\nevent, although exceptions also often show the stack trace across multiple lines. \\nIn monolithic server-based applications, you can write logs to a file on disk (a logfile) and then analyze \\nit with any tool. Since application execution is limited to a fixed server or VM, it g enerally isn’t too \\ncomplex to analyze the flow of events. However, in a distributed application where multiple services \\nare executed across many nodes in an orchestrator cluster, being able to correlate distributed events \\nis a challenge. \\nA microservice-based application should not try to store the output stream of events or logfiles by \\nitself, and not even try to manage the routing of the events to a central place. It should be \\ntransparent, meaning that each process should just write its event stream to a standard output that \\nunderneath will be collected by the execution environment infrastructure where it’s running. An \\nexample of these event stream routers is Microsoft.Diagnostic.EventFlow, which collects event streams \\nfrom multiple sources and publishes it to output systems.

In most cases, you need a management platform \\nthat will automatically start containers, scale out containers with multiple instances per image, \\nsuspend them or shut them down when needed, and ideally also control how they access resources \\nlike the network and data storage. \\nTo go beyond the management of individual containers or simple composed apps and move toward \\nlarger enterprise applications with microservices, you must turn to orchestration and clustering \\nplatforms. \\nFrom an architecture and development point of view, if you’re building large enterprise composed of \\nmicroservices-based applications, it’s important to understand the following platforms and products \\nthat support advanced scenarios: \\nClusters and orchestrators. When you need to scale out applications across many Docker hosts, as \\nwhen a large microservice-based application, it’s critical to be able to manage all those hosts as a \\nsingle cluster by abstracting the complexity of the underlying platform.

That is precisely what happens under the covers when you \\nenable Docker support in Visual Studio. Your Dockerfile will use an existing dotnet/core/aspnet \\nimage. \\nEarlier we explained which Docker images and repos you can use, depending on the framework and \\nOS you have chosen. For instance, if you want to use ASP.NET Core (Linux or Windows), the image to \\nuse is mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0. Therefore, you just need to specify what base Docker \\nimage you will use for your container. You do that by adding FROM \\nmcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0 to your Dockerfile. This will be automatically performed by \\nVisual Studio, but if you were to update the version, you update this value. \\nUsing an official .NET image repository from Docker Hub with a version number ensures that the same \\nlanguage features are available on all machines (including development, testing, and production). \\nThe following example shows a sample Dockerfile for an ASP.NET Core container.  \\nFROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0 \\nARG source \\nWORKDIR /app \\nEXPOSE 80 \\nCOPY ${source:-obj/Docker/publish} . \\nENTRYPOINT [\"dotnet\", \" MySingleContainerWebApp.dll \"] \\nIn this case, the image is based on version 6.0 of the official ASP.NET Core Docker image (multi -arch \\nfor Linux and Windows). This is the setting FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0. (For more \\ninformation about this base image, see the ASP.NET Core Docker Image page.) In the Dockerfile, you \\nalso need to instruct Docker to listen on the TCP port you will use at runtime (in this case, port 80, as \\nconfigured with the EXPOSE setting). \\nYou can specify additional configuration settings in the Dockerfile, depending on the language and \\nframework you’re using. For instance, the ENTRYPOINT line with [\"dotnet\", \\n\"MySingleContainerWebApp.dll\"] tells Docker to run a .NET application. If you’re using the SDK and \\nthe .NET CLI (dotnet CLI) to build and run the .NET application, this setting would be different. The \\nbottom line is that the ENTRYPOINT line and other settings will be different depending on the \\nlanguage and platform you choose for your application. \\nAdditional resources \\n• Building Docker Images for .NET 6 Applications \\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/docker/building-net-docker-images'),\n",

Similar to what you would do if you had to set up the \\nmachine from the command line. \\nIt starts with a base image that sets up the initial context, it’s like the startup filesystem, that sits on \\ntop of the host OS. It’s not an OS, but you can think of it like “the” OS inside the container. \\nThe execution of every command line creates a new layer on the filesystem with the changes from the \\nprevious one, so that, when combined, produce the resulting filesystem. \\nSince every new layer “rests” on top of the previous one and the resulting image size increases with \\nevery command, images can get very large if they have to include, for example, the SDK needed to \\nbuild and publish an application. \\nThis is where multi-stage builds get into the plot (from Docker 17.05 and higher) to do their magic.'),\n",

The general strategy to \\nuse this feature is: \\n1. Use a base SDK image (doesn’t matter how large), with everything needed to b uild and publish \\nthe application to a folder and then \\n2. Use a base, small, runtime-only image and copy the publishing folder from the previous stage to \\nproduce a small final image. \\nProbably the best way to understand multi-stage is going through a Dockerfile in detail, line by line, \\nso let’s begin with the initial Dockerfile created by Visual Studio when adding Docker support to a \\nproject and will get into some optimizations later. \\nThe initial Dockerfile might look something like this: \\n 1  FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0 AS base \\n 2  WORKDIR /app \\n 3  EXPOSE 80 \\n 4 \\n 5  FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0 AS build \\n 6  WORKDIR /src \\n 7  COPY src/Services/Catalog/Catalog.API/Catalog.API.csproj … \\n 8  COPY src/BuildingBlocks/HealthChecks/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.HealthChecks … \\n 9  COPY src/BuildingBlocks/HealthChecks/src/Microsoft.Extensions.HealthChecks … \\n10  COPY src/BuildingBlocks/EventBus/IntegrationEventLogEF/ … \\n11  COPY src/BuildingBlocks/EventBus/EventBus/EventBus.csproj … \\n12  COPY src/BuildingBlocks/EventBus/EventBusRabbitMQ/EventBusRabbitMQ.csproj … \\n13  COPY src/BuildingBlocks/EventBus/EventBusServiceBus/EventBusServiceBus.csproj … \\n14  COPY src/BuildingBlocks/WebHostCustomization/WebHost.Customization … \\n15  COPY src/BuildingBlocks/HealthChecks/src/Microsoft.Extensions … \\n16  COPY src/BuildingBlocks/HealthChecks/src/Microsoft.Extensions … \\n17  RUN dotnet restore src/Services/Catalog/Catalog.API/Catalog.API.csproj \\n18  COPY . . \\n19  WORKDIR /src/src/Services/Catalog/Catalog.API \\n20  RUN dotnet build Catalog.API.csproj -c Release -o /app \\n21 \\n22  FROM build AS publish \\n23  RUN dotnet publish Catalog.API.csproj -c Release -o /app \\n24 \\n25  FROM base AS final \\n26  WORKDIR /app \\n27  COPY --from=publish /app . \\n28  ENTRYPOINT [\"dotnet\", \"Catalog.API.dll\"] \\nAnd these are the details, line by line: \\n• Line #1: Begin a stage with a “small” runtime-only base image, call it base for reference. \\n• Line #2: Create the /app directory in the image. \\n• Line #3: Expose port 80.'),\n",

Creating a custom Docker image \\nOptionally, instead of directly running docker build from the project folder, you can first generate a \\ndeployable folder with the required .NET libraries and binaries by running dotnet publish, and then \\nuse the docker build command. \\nThis will create a Docker image with the name cesardl/netcore-webapi-microservice-\\ndocker:first.

Define your services in docker-compose.yml when building a \\nmulti-container Docker application \\nThe docker-compose.yml file lets you define a set of related services to be deployed as a composed \\napplication with deployment commands.

In later \\nsections, you will learn how to split the docker-compose.yml configuration into multiple docker-\\ncompose files and override values depending on the environment and execution type (debug or \\nrelease). \\nThe docker-compose.yml file example defines four services: the webmvc service (a web application), \\ntwo microservices (ordering-api and basket-api), and one data source container, sqldata, based on \\nSQL Server for Linux running as a container. Each service will be deployed as a container, so a Docker \\nimage is required for each. \\nThe docker-compose.yml file specifies not only what containers are being used, but how they are \\nindividually configured. For instance, the webmvc container definition in the .yml file: \\n• Uses a pre-built eshop/web:latest image. However, you could also configure the image to be \\nbuilt as part of the docker-compose execution with an additional configuration based on a build: \\nsection in the docker-compose file. \\n• Initializes two environment variables (CatalogUrl and OrderingUrl). \\n• Forwards the exposed port 80 on the container to the external port 80 on the host machine.  \\n• Links the web app to the catalog and ordering service with the depends_on setting. This causes \\nthe service to wait until those services are started. \\nWe will revisit the docker-compose.yml file in a later section when we cover how to implement \\nmicroservices and multi-container apps. \\nWorking with docker-compose.yml in Visual Studio 2022 \\nBesides adding a Dockerfile to a project, as we mentioned before, Visual Studio 2017 (from version \\n15.8 on) can add orchestrator support for Docker Compose to a solution.  \\nWhen you add container orchestrator support, as shown in Figure 5-7, for the first time, Visual Studio \\ncreates the Dockerfile for the project and creates a new (service section) project in your solution with \\nseveral global docker-compose*.yml files, and then adds the project to those files.

This design decision was made only to make it \\neasy for a developer to get the code from GitHub, clone it, and open it in Visual Studio or Visual \\nStudio Code.

Additionally, when an issue in a microservice is resolved, you can deploy just the \\naffected microservice without impacting the rest of the application. \\nYou can use the latest technologies. Because you can start developing services independently and \\nrun them side by side (thanks to containers and .NET), you can start using the latest technologies and \\nframeworks expediently instead of being stuck on an older stack or framework for the whole \\napplication. \\nDownsides of a microservice-based solution \\nA microservice-based solution like this also has some drawbacks: \\nDistributed application. Distributing the application adds complexity for developers when they are \\ndesigning and building the services. For example, developers must implement inter -service \\ncommunication using protocols like HTTP or AMPQ, which adds complexity for testing and exception \\nhandling. It also adds latency to the system. \\nDeployment complexity. An application that has dozens of microservices types and needs high \\nscalability (it needs to be able to create many instances per service and balance those services across \\nmany hosts) means a high degree of deployment complexity for IT operations and management. If \\nyou are not using a microservice-oriented infrastructure (like an orchestrator and scheduler), that \\nadditional complexity can require far more development efforts than the business application itself.  \\nAtomic transactions. Atomic transactions between multiple microservices usually are not possible. \\nThe business requirements have to embrace eventual consistency between multiple microservices. \\nIncreased global resource needs (total memory, drives, and network resources for all the servers or \\nhosts). In many cases, when you replace a monolithic application with a microservices approach, the \\namount of initial global resources needed by the new microservice-based application will be larger \\nthan the infrastructure needs of the original monolithic application. This approach is because the \\nhigher degree of granularity and distributed services requires more global resources. However, g iven \\nthe low cost of resources in general and the benefit of being able to scale out certain areas of the \\napplication compared to long-term costs when evolving monolithic applications, the increased use of \\nresources is usually a good tradeoff for large, long-term applications. \\nIssues with direct client-to-microservice communication. When the application is large, with \\ndozens of microservices, there are challenges and limitations if the application requires direct client -\\nto-microservice communications. One problem is a potential mismatch between the needs of the \\nclient and the APIs exposed by each of the microservices. In certain cases, the client application might \\nneed to make many separate requests to compose the UI, which can be inefficient over the Intern et \\nand would be impractical over a mobile network. Therefore, requests from the client application to the \\nback-end system should be minimized. \\nAnother problem with direct client-to-microservice communications is that some microservices might \\nbe using protocols that are not Web-friendly. One service might use a binary protocol, while another \\nservice might use AMQP messaging. Those protocols are not firewall-friendly and are best used \\ninternally. Usually, an application should use protocols such as HTTP and W ebSockets for \\ncommunication outside of the firewall.'),\n",

Over time developers might want to change how the system is \\npartitioned into services. For example, they might merge two services or split a service into two or \\nmore services. However, if clients communicate directly with the services, performing this kind of \\nrefactoring can break compatibility with client apps. \\nAs mentioned in the architecture section, when designing and building a complex application based \\non microservices, you might consider the use of multiple fine-grained API Gateways instead of the \\nsimpler direct client-to-microservice communication approach. \\nPartitioning the microservices. Finally, no matter, which approach you take for your microservice \\narchitecture, another challenge is deciding how to partition an end-to-end application into multiple \\nmicroservices. As noted in the architecture section of the guide, there are several techniques and \\napproaches you can take. Basically, you need to identify areas of the application that are decoupled \\nfrom the other areas and that have a low number of hard dependencies. In many cases, this approach \\nis aligned to partitioning services by use case. For example, in our e-shop application, we have an \\nordering service that is responsible for all the business logic related to the order process. We also \\nhave the catalog service and the basket service that implement other capabilities. Ideally, each service \\nshould have only a small set of responsibilities. This approach is similar to the single responsibility \\nprinciple (SRP) applied to classes, which states that a class should only have one reason to change. But \\nin this case, it is about microservices, so the scope will be larger than a single class. Most of all, a \\nmicroservice has to be autonomous, end to end, including responsibility for its own data sources.  \\nExternal versus internal architecture and design patterns \\nThe external architecture is the microservice architecture composed by multiple services, following the \\nprinciples described in the architecture section of this guide. However, depending on the nature of \\neach microservice, and independently of high-level microservice architecture you choose, it is \\ncommon and sometimes advisable to have different internal architectures, each based on different \\npatterns, for different microservices. The microservices can even use different technologies and \\nprogramming languages. Figure 6-2 illustrates this diversity.'),\n",

Therefore, their internal architecture and design is \\nstraightforward. However, you might have other microservices, such as the ordering microservice, \\nwhich is more complex and represents ever-changing business rules with a high degree of domain \\ncomplexity. In cases like these, you might want to implement more advanced patterns within a \\nparticular microservice, like the ones defined with domain-driven design (DDD) approaches, as we are \\ndoing in the eShopOnContainers ordering microservice. (We will review these DDD patterns in the \\nsection later that explains the implementation of the eShopOnContainers ordering microservice.) \\nAnother reason for a different technology per microservice might be the nature of each microservice. \\nFor example, it might be better to use a functional programming language like F#, or even a language \\nlike R if you are targeting AI and machine learning domains, instead of a more object -oriented \\nprogramming language like C#. \\nThe bottom line is that each microservice can have a different internal architecture based on different \\ndesign patterns. Not all microservices should be implemented using advanced DDD patterns, because \\nthat would be over-engineering them.

The only thing you would need to \\nchange is the connection string in the ASP.NET Web API microservice. \\nThe data model \\nWith EF Core, data access is performed by using a model. A model is made up of (domain model) \\nentity classes and a derived context (DbContext) that represents a session with the database, allowing \\nyou to query and save data. You can generate a model from an existing database, manually code a \\nmodel to match your database, or use EF migrations technique to create a database from your model, \\nusing the code-first approach (that makes it easy to evolve the database as your model changes over \\ntime). For the catalog microservice, the last approach has been used. You can see an example of the \\nCatalogItem entity class in the following code example, which is a simple Plain Old Class Object \\n(POCO) entity class. \\npublic class CatalogItem \\n{ \\n    public int Id { get; set; } \\n    public string Name { get; set; } \\n    public string Description { get; set; } \\n    public decimal Price { get; set; } \\n    public string PictureFileName { get; set; } \\n    public string PictureUri { get; set; } \\n    public int CatalogTypeId { get; set; } \\n    public CatalogType CatalogType { get; set; } \\n    public int CatalogBrandId { get; set; } \\n    public CatalogBrand CatalogBrand { get; set; } \\n    public int AvailableStock { get; set; } \\n    public int RestockThreshold { get; set; } \\n    public int MaxStockThreshold { get; set; } \\n \\n    public bool OnReorder { get; set; } \\n    public CatalogItem() { } \\n \\n    // Additional code ... \\n} \\nYou also need a DbContext that represents a session with the database. For the catalog microservice, \\nthe CatalogContext class derives from the DbContext base class, as shown in the following example:  \\npublic class CatalogContext : DbContext \\n{ \\n    public CatalogContext(DbContextOptions<CatalogContext> options) : base(options) \\n    { } \\n    public DbSet<CatalogItem> CatalogItems { get; set; } \\n    public DbSet<CatalogBrand> CatalogBrands { get; set; } \\n    public DbSet<CatalogType> CatalogTypes { get; set; } \\n \\n    // Additional code ... \\n} \\nYou can have additional DbContext implementations. For example, in the sample Catalog.API \\nmicroservice, there’s a second DbContext named CatalogContextSeed where it automatically \\npopulates the sample data the first time it tries to access the database.

You should include Swagger description metadata with any kind of \\nmicroservice, either data-driven microservices or more advanced domain-driven microservices (as \\nexplained in the following section). \\nThe heart of Swagger is the Swagger specification, which is API description metadata in a JSON or \\nYAML file.

Dozens of products \\nand commercial tools and many libraries and frameworks support Swagger. Microsoft has high-level \\nproducts and tools that can automatically consume Swagger-based APIs, such as the following: \\n• AutoRest. You can automatically generate .NET client classes for calling Swagger. This tool can \\nbe used from the CLI and it also integrates with Visual Studio for easy use through the GUI.  \\n• Microsoft Flow. You can automatically use and integrate your API into a high-level Microsoft \\nFlow workflow, with no programming skills required. \\n• Microsoft PowerApps. You can automatically consume your API from PowerApps mobile apps \\nbuilt with PowerApps Studio, with no programming skills required. \\n• Azure App Service Logic Apps. You can automatically use and integrate your API into an Azure \\nApp Service Logic App, with no programming skills required. \\nAbility to automatically generate API documentation. When you create large-scale RESTful APIs, \\nsuch as complex microservice-based applications, you need to handle many endpoints with different \\ndata models used in the request and response payloads. Having proper documentation and having a \\nsolid API explorer, as you get with Swagger, is key for the success of your API and adoption by \\ndevelopers. \\nSwagger’s metadata is what Microsoft Flow, PowerApps, and Azure Logic Apps use to understand how \\nto use APIs and connect to them. \\nThere are several options to automate Swagger metadata generation for ASP.NET Core REST API \\napplications, in the form of functional API help pages, based on swagger-ui. \\nProbably the best know is Swashbuckle, which is currently used in eShopOnContainers and we’ll cover \\nin some detail in this guide but there’s also the option to use NSwag, which can generate Typescript \\nand C# API clients, as well as C# controllers, from a Swagger or OpenAPI specification and even by \\nscanning the .dll that contains the controllers, using NSwagStudio. \\nHow to automate API Swagger metadata generation with the Swashbuckle NuGet \\npackage \\nGenerating Swagger metadata manually (in a JSON or YAML file) can be tedious work.

For simplicity’s sake, there is no build: key \\nsetting in the file. This means that the image must have been previously built (with docker  build) \\nor have been downloaded (with the docker pull command) from any Docker registry.  \\n• It defines an environment variable named ConnectionString with the connection string to be \\nused by Entity Framework to access the SQL Server instance that contains the catalog data \\nmodel. In this case, the same SQL Server container is holding multiple databases. Therefore, you \\nneed less memory in your development machine for Docker. However, you could also deploy \\none SQL Server container for each microservice database. \\n• The SQL Server name is sqldata, which is the same name used for the container that is running \\nthe SQL Server instance for Linux. This is convenient; being able to use this name resolution \\n(internal to the Docker host) will resolve the network address so you don’t need to know the \\ninternal IP for the containers you are accessing from other containers. \\nBecause the connection string is defined by an environment variable, you could set that variable \\nthrough a different mechanism and at a different time. For example, you could set a different \\nconnection string when deploying to production in the final hosts, or by doing it from your CI/CD  \\npipelines in Azure DevOps Services or your preferred DevOps system. \\n• It exposes port 80 for internal access to the catalog-api service within the Docker host. The host \\nis currently a Linux VM because it is based on a Docker image for Linux, but you could configure \\nthe container to run on a Windows image instead. \\n• It forwards the exposed port 80 on the container to port 5101 on the Docker host machine (the \\nLinux VM). \\n• It links the web service to the sqldata service (the SQL Server instance for Linux database \\nrunning in a container). When you specify this dependency, the catalog-api container will not \\nstart until the sqldata container has already started; this aspect is important because catalog-api \\nneeds to have the SQL Server database up and running first. However, this kind of container \\ndependency is not enough in many cases, because Docker checks only at the container level. \\nSometimes the service (in this case SQL Server) might still not be ready, so it is advisable to \\nimplement retry logic with exponential backoff in your client microservices. That way, if a \\ndependency container is not ready for a short time, the application will still be resilient. \\n• It is configured to allow access to external servers: the extra_hosts setting allows you to access \\nexternal servers or machines outside of the Docker host (that is, outside the default Linux VM, \\nwhich is a development Docker host), such as a local SQL Server instance on your development \\nPC. \\nThere are also other, more advanced docker-compose.yml settings that we’ll discuss in the following \\nsections.'),\n",

The most straightforward tool is the docker-compose command. \\nTherefore, by using the docker-compose command you can target the following main scenarios. \\nDevelopment environments \\nWhen you develop applications, it is important to be able to run an application in an isolated \\ndevelopment environment. You can use the docker-compose CLI command to create that \\nenvironment or Visual Studio, which uses docker-compose under the covers. \\nThe docker-compose.yml file allows you to configure and document all your application’s service \\ndependencies (other services, cache, databases, queues, etc.). Using the docker-compose CLI \\ncommand, you can create and start one or more containers for each dependency with a single \\ncommand (docker-compose up). \\nThe docker-compose.yml files are configuration files interpreted by Docker engine but also serve as \\nconvenient documentation files about the composition of your multi-container application. \\nTesting environments \\nAn important part of any continuous deployment (CD) or continuous integration (CI) process are the \\nunit tests and integration tests. These automated tests require an isolated environment so they are \\nnot impacted by the users or any other change in the application’s data. \\nWith Docker Compose, you can create and destroy that isolated environment very easily in a few \\ncommands from your command prompt or scripts, like the following commands:  \\ndocker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-test.override.yml up -d \\n./run_unit_tests \\ndocker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-test.override.yml down \\nProduction deployments \\nYou can also use Compose to deploy to a remote Docker Engine. A typical case is to deploy to a \\nsingle Docker host instance (like a production VM or server provisioned with Docker Machine). \\nIf you are using any other orchestrator (Azure Service Fabric, Kubernetes, etc.), you might need to add \\nsetup and metadata configuration settings like those in docker-compose.yml, but in the format \\nrequired by the other orchestrator. \\nIn any case, docker-compose is a convenient tool and metadata format for development, testing and \\nproduction workflows, although the production workflow might vary on the orchestrator you are \\nusing. \\nUsing multiple docker-compose files to handle several environments \\nWhen targeting different environments, you should use multiple compose files.

Development: The priority is the ability to quickly iterate and debug changes, an d where size is \\nsecondary. \\n2. Build: The priority is compiling the application, and the image includes binaries and other \\ndependencies to optimize binaries. \\n3. Production: The focus is fast deploying and starting of containers, so these images are limited \\nto the binaries and content needed to run the application. \\nThe .NET team provides four basic variants in dotnet/ (at Docker Hub): \\n1. sdk: for development and build scenarios \\n2. aspnet: for ASP.NET production scenarios \\n3. runtime: for .NET production scenarios \\n4. runtime-deps: for production scenarios of self-contained applications \\nFor faster startup, runtime images also automatically set aspnetcore_urls to port 80 and use Ngen to \\ncreate a native image cache of assemblies. \\nAdditional resources \\n• Building Optimized Docker Images with ASP.NET Core \\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/archive/blogs/stevelasker/building-optimized-docker-images-with-\\nasp-net-core \\n• Building Docker Images for .NET Applications \\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/docker/building-net-docker-images \\nUse a database server running as a container \\nYou can have your databases (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) on regular standalone servers, in \\non-premises clusters, or in PaaS services in the cloud like Azure SQL DB.

Keep in mind that this is a good -enough \\nsolution for development and, perhaps, testing but not for production. \\nThe SQL Server container in the sample application is configured with the following YAML code in the \\ndocker-compose.yml file, which is executed when you run docker-compose up. Note that the YAML \\ncode has consolidated configuration information from the generic docker-compose.yml file and the \\ndocker-compose.override.yml file.

The in-memory database does not support many constraints that \\nare specific to a particular database. For instance, you might add a unique index on a column in your \\nEF Core model and write a test against your in-memory database to check that it does not let you add \\na duplicate value. But when you are using the in-memory database, you cannot handle unique indexes \\non a column. Therefore, the in-memory database does not behave exactly the same as a real SQL \\nServer database—it does not emulate database-specific constraints. \\nEven so, an in-memory database is still useful for testing and prototyping. But if you want to create \\naccurate integration tests that take into account the behavior of a specific database implementation, \\nyou need to use a real database like SQL Server. For that purpose, running SQL Server in a container is \\na great choice and more accurate than the EF Core InMemory database provider. \\nUsing a Redis cache service running in a container \\nYou can run Redis on a container, especially for development and testing and for proof -of-concept \\nscenarios. This scenario is convenient, because you can have all your dependencies running on \\ncontainers—not just for your local development machines, but for your testing environments in your \\nCI/CD pipelines. \\nHowever, when you run Redis in production, it is better to look for a high-availability solution like \\nRedis Microsoft Azure, which runs as a PaaS (Platform as a Service).

Event-driven communication based on an event bus \\nThis section describes how you can implement this type of communication with .NET by using a \\ngeneric event bus interface, as shown in Figure 6-18.

But these technologies are at different levels. For instance, \\nRabbitMQ, a messaging broker transport, is at a lower level than commercial products like Azure \\nService Bus, NServiceBus, MassTransit, or Brighter. Most of these products can work on top of either \\nRabbitMQ or Azure Service Bus. Your choice of product depends on how many features and how \\nmuch out-of-the-box scalability you need for your application. \\nFor implementing just an event bus proof-of-concept for your development environment, as in the \\neShopOnContainers sample, a simple implementation on top of RabbitMQ running as a container \\nmight be enough. But for mission-critical and production systems that need high scalability, you \\nmight want to evaluate and use Azure Service Bus. \\nIf you require high-level abstractions and richer features like Sagas for long-running processes that \\nmake distributed development easier, other commercial and open-source service buses like \\nNServiceBus, MassTransit, and Brighter are worth evaluating. In this case, the abstractio ns and API to \\nuse would usually be directly the ones provided by those high-level service buses instead of your own \\nabstractions (like the simple event bus abstractions provided at eShopOnContainers).

Once you have \\ndecided that you want to have asynchronous and event-driven communication, as explained in the \\ncurrent section, you should choose the service bus product that best fits your needs for production.  \\nIntegration events \\nIntegration events are used for bringing domain state in sync across multiple microservices or external \\nsystems. This functionality is done by publishing integration events outside the microservice. When an \\nevent is published to multiple receiver microservices (to as many microservices as are subscribed to \\nthe integration event), the appropriate event handler in each receiver microservice handles the event.  \\nAn integration event is basically a data-holding class, as in the following example: \\npublic class ProductPriceChangedIntegrationEvent : IntegrationEvent \\n{ \\n    public int ProductId { get; private set; } \\n    public decimal NewPrice { get; private set; } \\n    public decimal OldPrice { get; private set; } \\n \\n    public ProductPriceChangedIntegrationEvent(int productId, decimal newPrice, \\n        decimal oldPrice) \\n    { \\n        ProductId = productId; \\n        NewPrice = newPrice; \\n        OldPrice = oldPrice; \\n    } \\n} \\nThe integration events can be defined at the application level of each microservice, so they are \\ndecoupled from other microservices, in a way comparable to how ViewModels are defined in the \\nserver and client. What is not recommended is sharing a common integration events library across \\nmultiple microservices; doing that would be coupling those microservices with a single event \\ndefinition data library. You do not want to do that for the same reasons that you do not want to share \\na common domain model across multiple microservices: microservices must be completely \\nautonomous. \\nThere are only a few kinds of libraries you should share across microservices. One i s libraries that are \\nfinal application blocks, like the Event Bus client API, as in eShopOnContainers. Another is libraries \\nthat constitute tools that could also be shared as NuGet components, like JSON serializers.  \\nThe event bus \\nAn event bus allows publish/subscribe-style communication between microservices without requiring \\nthe components to explicitly be aware of each other, as shown in Figure 6-19.'),\n",

Publish/subscribe basics with an event bus \\nThe above diagram shows that microservice A publishes to Event Bus, which distributes to subscribing \\nmicroservices B and C, without the publisher needing to know the subscribers. The event bus is \\nrelated to the Observer pattern and the publish-subscribe pattern. \\nObserver pattern \\nIn the Observer pattern, your primary object (known as the Observable) notifies other interested \\nobjects (known as Observers) with relevant information (events). \\nPublish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) pattern \\nThe purpose of the Publish/Subscribe pattern is the same as the Observer pattern: you want to notify \\nother services when certain events take place. But there is an important difference between the \\nObserver and Pub/Sub patterns. In the observer pattern, the broadcast is performed directly from the \\nobservable to the observers, so they “know” each other. But when using a Pub/Sub pattern, there is a \\nthird component, called broker, or message broker or event bus, which is known by both the \\npublisher and subscriber. Therefore, when using the Pub/Sub pattern the publisher and the \\nsubscribers are precisely decoupled thanks to the mentioned event bus or message broker. \\nThe middleman or event bus \\nHow do you achieve anonymity between publisher and subscriber? An easy way is let a middleman \\ntake care of all the communication. An event bus is one such middleman. \\nAn event bus is typically composed of two parts: \\n• The abstraction or interface. \\n• One or more implementations. \\nIn Figure 6-19 you can see how, from an application point of view, the event bus is nothing more than \\na Pub/Sub channel.

For instance, in the simplified example shown earlier, the \\ncode commits data to the database when the product price is changed and then publishes a \\nProductPriceChangedIntegrationEvent message. Initially, it might look essential that these two \\noperations be performed atomically. However, if you are using a distributed transaction involving the \\ndatabase and the message broker, as you do in older systems like Microsoft Message Queuing \\n(MSMQ), this approach is not recommended for the reasons described by the CAP theorem. \\nBasically, you use microservices to build scalable and highly available systems. Simplifying somewhat, \\nthe CAP theorem says that you cannot build a (distributed) database (or a microservice that owns its \\nmodel) that’s continually available, strongly consistent, and tolerant to any partition. You must choose \\ntwo of these three properties. \\nIn microservices-based architectures, you should choose availability and tolerance, and you should \\nde-emphasize strong consistency. Therefore, in most modern microservice-based applications, you \\nusually do not want to use distributed transactions in messaging, as you do when you implement \\ndistributed transactions based on the Windows Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC) with \\nMSMQ. \\nLet’s go back to the initial issue and its example. If the service crashes after the database is updated \\n(in this case, right after the line of code with _context.SaveChangesAsync()), but before the \\nintegration event is published, the overall system could become inconsistent. This approach might be \\nbusiness critical, depending on the specific business operation you are dealing with.  \\nAs mentioned earlier in the architecture section, you can have several approaches for dealing with this \\nissue: \\n• Using the full Event Sourcing pattern. \\n• Using transaction log mining. \\n• Using the Outbox pattern. This is a transactional table to store the integration events (extending \\nthe local transaction). \\nFor this scenario, using the full Event Sourcing (ES) pattern is one of the best approaches, if not the \\nbest. However, in many application scenarios, you might not be able to implement a full ES system. ES \\nmeans storing only domain events in your transactional database, instead of storing current state \\ndata. Storing only domain events can have great benefits, such as having the history of your system \\navailable and being able to determine the state of your system at any moment in the past. However,'),\n",

For example, you would want to use a database specifically \\nmade for event sourcing, such as Event Store, or a document-oriented database such as Azure \\nCosmos DB, MongoDB, Cassandra, CouchDB, or RavenDB. ES is a great approach for this problem, but \\nnot the easiest solution unless you are already familiar with event sourcing. \\nThe option to use transaction log mining initially looks transparent. However, to use this approach, \\nthe microservice has to be coupled to your RDBMS transaction log, such as the SQL Server transaction \\nlog. This approach is probably not desirable. Another drawback is that the low-level updates recorded \\nin the transaction log might not be at the same level as your high-level integration events. If so, the \\nprocess of reverse-engineering those transaction log operations can be difficult. \\nA balanced approach is a mix of a transactional database table and a simplified ES pattern. You can \\nuse a state such as “ready to publish the event,” which you set in the original event when you commit \\nit to the integration events table. You then try to publish the event to the event bus. If the publish-\\nevent action succeeds, you start another transaction in the origin service and move the state from \\n“ready to publish the event” to “event already published.” \\nIf the publish-event action in the event bus fails, the data still will not be inconsistent within the origin \\nmicroservice—it is still marked as “ready to publish the event,” and with respect to the rest of the \\nservices, it will eventually be consistent. You can always have background jobs checking the state of \\nthe transactions or integration events. If the job finds an event in the “ready to publish the event” \\nstate, it can try to republish that event to the event bus. \\nNotice that with this approach, you are persisting only the integration events for each origin \\nmicroservice, and only the events that you want to communicate to other microservices or external \\nsystems. In contrast, in a full ES system, you store all domain events as well.  \\nTherefore, this balanced approach is a simplified ES system. You need a list of integrat ion events with \\ntheir current state (“ready to publish” versus “published”). But you only need to implement these \\nstates for the integration events. And in this approach, you do not need to store all your domain data \\nas events in the transactional database, as you would in a full ES system. \\nIf you are already using a relational database, you can use a transactional table to store integration \\nevents. To achieve atomicity in your application, you use a two-step process based on local \\ntransactions. Basically, you have an IntegrationEvent table in the same database where you have your \\ndomain entities. That table works as an insurance for achieving atomicity so that you include persisted \\nintegration events into the same transactions that are committing your domain data. \\nStep by step, the process goes like this: \\n1. The application begins a local database transaction. \\n2. It then updates the state of your domain entities and inserts an event into the integration event \\ntable. \\n3. Finally, it commits the transaction, so you get the desired atomicity and then \\n4. You publish the event somehow (next). \\nWhen implementing the steps of publishing the events, you have these choices:'),\n",

On the other hand, if the \\n“redelivered” flag is not set, it is guaranteed that the message has not been sent more than once. \\nTherefore, the receiver needs to deduplicate messages or process messages in an idempotent way \\nonly if the “redelivered” flag is set in the message. \\nAdditional resources \\n• Forked eShopOnContainers using NServiceBus (Particular Software) \\nhttps://go.particular.net/eShopOnContainers \\n• Event Driven Messaging \\nhttps://patterns.arcitura.com/soa-patterns/design_patterns/event_driven_messaging \\n• Jimmy Bogard.

In this case, it means starting the services (for example, by using docker -\\ncompose up). \\nImplementing unit tests for ASP.NET Core Web APIs \\nUnit testing involves testing a part of an application in isolation from its infrastructure and \\ndependencies. When you unit test controller logic, only the content of a single action or method is \\ntested, not the behavior of its dependencies or of the framework itself. Unit tests do not detect issues \\nin the interaction between components—that is the purpose of integration testing. \\nAs you unit test your controller actions, make sure you focus only on their behavior. A controller unit \\ntest avoids things like filters, routing, or model binding (the mapping of request data to a ViewModel \\nor DTO). Because they focus on testing just one thing, unit tests are generally simple to write and \\nquick to run. A well-written set of unit tests can be run frequently without much overhead. \\nUnit tests are implemented based on test frameworks like xUnit.net, MSTest, Moq, or NUnit. For the \\neShopOnContainers sample application, we are using xUnit. \\nWhen you write a unit test for a Web API controller, you instantiate the controller class directly using \\nthe new keyword in C#, so that the test will run as fast as possible. The following example shows how \\nto do this when using xUnit as the Test framework. \\n[Fact] \\npublic async Task Get_order_detail_success() \\n{ \\n    //Arrange \\n    var fakeOrderId = \"12\"; \\n    var fakeOrder = GetFakeOrder(); \\n \\n    //... \\n \\n    //Act \\n    var orderController = new OrderController( \\n        _orderServiceMock.Object, \\n        _basketServiceMock.Object, \\n        _identityParserMock.Object); \\n \\n    orderController.ControllerContext.HttpContext = _contextMock.Object; \\n    var actionResult = await orderController.Detail(fakeOrderId); \\n \\n    //Assert \\n    var viewResult = Assert.IsType<ViewResult>(actionResult); \\n    Assert.IsAssignableFrom<Order>(viewResult.ViewData.Model); \\n} \\nImplementing integration and functional tests for each microservice \\nAs noted, integration tests and functional tests have different purposes and goals.

Unit tests use fakes or mock \\nobjects in place of these concerns. But the purpose of integration tests is to confirm that the system \\nworks as expected with these systems, so for integration testing you do not use fakes or mock objects. \\nInstead, you include the infrastructure, like database access or service invocation from other services.  \\nBecause integration tests exercise larger segments of code than unit tests, and because integration \\ntests rely on infrastructure elements, they tend to be orders of magnitude slower than unit tests. Thus, \\nit is a good idea to limit how many integration tests you write and run. \\nASP.NET Core includes a built-in test web host that can be used to handle HTTP requests without \\nnetwork overhead, meaning that you can run those tests faster than when using a real web host.

You can also use \\nanother compose file that would run your tests in the image you are targeting.

The WebHost uses \\nthese very same IHostedServices for background tasks. \\nA Host (base class implementing IHost) was introduced in .NET Core 2.1. Basically, a Host allows you \\nto have a similar infrastructure than what you have with WebHost (dependency injection, hosted \\nservices, etc.), but in this case, you just want to have a simple and lighter process as the host, with \\nnothing related to MVC, Web API or HTTP server features. \\nTherefore, you can choose and either create a specialized host-process with IHost to handle the \\nhosted services and nothing else, such a microservice made just for hosting the IHostedServices, or \\nyou can alternatively extend an existing ASP.NET Core WebHost, such as an existing ASP.NET Core Web \\nAPI or MVC app. \\nEach approach has pros and cons depending on your business and scalability needs.

Basically, you have to register the hosted services within the familiar \\nConfigureServices() method of the Startup class, as in the following code from a typical ASP.NET \\nWebHost. \\npublic IServiceProvider ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) \\n{ \\n    //Other DI registrations; \\n \\n    // Register Hosted Services \\n    services.AddHostedService<GracePeriodManagerService>(); \\n    services.AddHostedService<MyHostedServiceB>(); \\n    services.AddHostedService<MyHostedServiceC>(); \\n    //... \\n} \\nIn that code, the GracePeriodManagerService hosted service is real code from the Ordering business \\nmicroservice in eShopOnContainers, while the other two are just two additional samples.  \\nThe IHostedService background task execution is coordinated with the lifetime of the application \\n(host or microservice, for that matter). You register tasks when the application starts and you have the \\nopportunity to do some graceful action or clean-up when the application is shutting down. \\nWithout using IHostedService, you could always start a background thread to run any task. The \\ndifference is precisely at the app’s shutdown time when that thread would simply be killed without \\nhaving the opportunity to run graceful clean-up actions. \\nThe IHostedService interface \\nWhen you register an IHostedService, .NET will call the StartAsync() and StopAsync() methods of \\nyour IHostedService type during application start and stop respectively.

However, deploying into any orchestrator would \\nbe similar, but any container in the diagram could be scaled out in the orchestrator. \\nIn addition, the infrastructure assets such as databases, cache, and message brokers should be \\noffloaded from the orchestrator and deployed into high available systems for infrastructure, like Azure \\nSQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Redis, Azure Service Bus, or any HA clustering solution on -\\npremises. \\nAs you can also notice in the diagram, having several API Gateways allows multiple development \\nteams to be autonomous (in this case Marketing features vs. Shopping features) when developing and \\ndeploying their microservices plus their own related API Gateways. \\nIf you had a single monolithic API Gateway that would mean a single point to be updated by several \\ndevelopment teams, which could couple all the microservices with a single part of the application. \\nGoing much further in the design, sometimes a fine-grained API Gateway can also be limited to a \\nsingle business microservice depending on the chosen architecture. Having the API Gateway’s \\nboundaries dictated by the business or domain will help you to get a better design. \\nFor instance, fine granularity in the API Gateway tier can be especially useful for more advanced \\ncomposite UI applications that are based on microservices, because the concept of a fine -grained API \\nGateway is similar to a UI composition service. \\nWe delve into more details in the previous section Creating composite UI based on microservices. \\nAs a key takeaway, for many medium- and large-size applications, using a custom-built API Gateway \\nproduct is usually a good approach, but not as a single monolithic aggregator or unique central \\ncustom API Gateway unless that API Gateway allows multiple independent configuration areas for the \\nseveral development teams creating autonomous microservices.'),\n",

Usually this configuration will just contain one entry but sometimes \\nyou might want to load balance requests to your downstream services and Ocelot lets you add more \\nthan one entry and then select a load balancer. But if using Azure and any orchestrator it is probably a \\nbetter idea to load balance with the cloud and orchestrator infrastructure. \\nThe UpstreamPathTemplate is the URL that Ocelot will use to identify which \\nDownstreamPathTemplate to use for a given request from the client. Finally, the \\nUpstreamHttpMethod is used so Ocelot can distinguish between different requests (GET, POST, PUT) \\nto the same URL. \\nAt this point, you could have a single Ocelot API Gateway (ASP.NET Core WebHost) using one or \\nmultiple merged configuration.json files or you can also store the configuration in a Consul KV store. \\nBut as introduced in the architecture and design sections, if you really want to have auto nomous \\nmicroservices, it might be better to split that single monolithic API Gateway into multiple API \\nGateways and/or BFF (Backend for Frontend). For that purpose, let’s see how to implement that \\napproach with Docker containers.'),\n",

The related \\nterm Command Query Separation (CQS) was originally defined by Bertrand Meyer in his book Object-\\nOriented Software Construction. The basic idea is that you can divide a system’s operations into two \\nsharply separated categories: \\n• Queries. These queries return a result and do not change the state of the system, and they are \\nfree of side effects. \\n• Commands. These commands change the state of a system.'),\n",

Each method either returns state or mutates state, but not both. Even a single repository \\npattern object can comply with CQS. CQS can be considered a foundational principle for CQRS.  \\nCommand and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) was introduced by Greg Young and strongly \\npromoted by Udi Dahan and others. It is based on the CQS principle, although it is more detailed. It \\ncan be considered a pattern based on commands and events plus optionally on asynchronous \\nmessages. In many cases, CQRS is related to more advanced scenarios, like having a different physical \\ndatabase for reads (queries) than for writes (updates). Moreover, a more evolved CQRS system might \\nimplement Event-Sourcing (ES) for your updates database, so you would only store events in the \\ndomain model instead of storing the current-state data. However, this approach is not used in this \\nguide. This guide uses the simplest CQRS approach, which consists of just separating the queries  from \\nthe commands. \\nThe separation aspect of CQRS is achieved by grouping query operations in one layer and commands \\nin another layer. Each layer has its own data model (note that we say model, not necessarily a different \\ndatabase) and is built using its own combination of patterns and technologies. More importantly, the \\ntwo layers can be within the same tier or microservice, as in the example (ordering microservice) used \\nfor this guide. Or they could be implemented on different microservices or processes s o they can be \\noptimized and scaled out separately without affecting one another. \\nCQRS means having two objects for a read/write operation where in other contexts there is one. There \\nare reasons to have a denormalized reads database, which you can learn about in more advanced \\nCQRS literature. But we are not using that approach here, where the goal is to have more flexibility in \\nthe queries instead of limiting the queries with constraints from DDD patterns like aggregates.  \\nAn example of this kind of service is the ordering microservice from the eShopOnContainers reference \\napplication. This service implements a microservice based on a simplified CQRS approach. It uses a \\nsingle data source or database, but two logical models plus DDD patterns for the tr ansactional \\ndomain, as shown in Figure 7-2.'),\n",

Hence, this is a \\nsimplified CQRS approach. \\nOn the other hand, commands, which trigger transactions and data updates, change state in the \\nsystem. With commands, you need to be careful when dealing with complexity and ever -changing \\nbusiness rules. This is where you want to apply DDD techniques to have a better modeled system.  \\nThe DDD patterns presented in this guide should not be applied universally. They introduce \\nconstraints on your design. Those constraints provide benefits such as higher quality over time, \\nespecially in commands and other code that modifies system state. However, those constraints add \\ncomplexity with fewer benefits for reading and querying data. \\nOne such pattern is the Aggregate pattern, which we examine more in later sections. Briefly, in the \\nAggregate pattern, you treat many domain objects as a single unit as a result of their relationship in \\nthe domain. You might not always gain advantages from this pattern in queries; it can increase the \\ncomplexity of query logic. For read-only queries, you do not get the advantages of treating multiple \\nobjects as a single Aggregate. You only get the complexity. \\nAs shown in Figure 7-2 in the previous section, this guide suggests using DDD patterns only in the \\ntransactional/updates area of your microservice (that is, as triggered by commands). Queries can \\nfollow a simpler approach and should be separated from commands, following a CQRS approach.  \\nFor implementing the “queries side”, you can choose between many approaches, from your full-blown \\nORM like EF Core, AutoMapper projections, stored procedures, views, materialized views or a micro \\nORM. \\nIn this guide and in eShopOnContainers (specifically the ordering microservice) we chose to \\nimplement straight queries using a micro ORM like Dapper. This guide lets you implement any query \\nbased on SQL statements to get the best performance, thanks to a light framework with little \\noverhead. \\nWhen you use this approach, any updates to your model that impact how entities are persisted to a \\nSQL database also need separate updates to SQL queries used by Dapper or any other separate (non-\\nEF) approaches to querying. \\nCQRS and DDD patterns are not top-level architectures \\nIt’s important to understand that CQRS and most DDD patterns (like DDD layers or a domain model \\nwith aggregates) are not architectural styles, but only architecture patterns. Microservices, SOA, and \\nevent-driven architecture (EDA) are examples of architectural styles. They describe a system of many \\ncomponents, such as many microservices. CQRS and DDD patterns describe something inside a single \\nsystem or component; in this case, something inside a microservice. \\nDifferent Bounded Contexts (BCs) will employ different patterns. They have different responsibilities, \\nand that leads to different solutions. It is worth emphasizing that forcing the same patter n everywhere \\nleads to failure. Do not use CQRS and DDD patterns everywhere. Many subsystems, BCs, or \\nmicroservices are simpler and can be implemented more easily using simple CRUD services or using \\nanother approach.'),\n",

The response types are handled in the \\nXML comments and data annotations. \\nWithout proper documentation in the Swagger UI, the consumer lacks knowledge of what types are \\nbeing returned or what HTTP codes can be returned. That problem is fixed by adding the \\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ProducesResponseTypeAttribute, so Swashbuckle can generate richer \\ninformation about the API return model and values, as shown in the following code:  \\nnamespace Microsoft.eShopOnContainers.Services.Ordering.API.Controllers \\n{ \\n    [Route(\"api/v1/[controller]\")] \\n    [Authorize] \\n    public class OrdersController : Controller \\n    { \\n        //Additional code... \\n        [Route(\"\")] \\n        [HttpGet] \\n        [ProducesResponseType(typeof(IEnumerable<OrderSummary>), \\n            (int)HttpStatusCode.OK)] \\n        public async Task<IActionResult> GetOrders() \\n        { \\n            var userid = _identityService.GetUserIdentity(); \\n            var orders = await _orderQueries \\n                .GetOrdersFromUserAsync(Guid.Parse(userid)); \\n            return Ok(orders); \\n        } \\n    } \\n} \\nHowever, the ProducesResponseType attribute cannot use dynamic as a type but requires to use \\nexplicit types, like the OrderSummary ViewModel DTO, shown in the following example: \\npublic class OrderSummary \\n{ \\n    public int ordernumber { get; set; } \\n    public DateTime date { get; set; } \\n    public string status { get; set; } \\n    public double total { get; set; } \\n} \\nThis is another reason why explicit returned types are better than dynamic types, in the long term. \\nWhen using the ProducesResponseType attribute, you can also specify what is the expected outcome \\nregarding possible HTTP errors/codes, like 200, 400, etc.'),\n",

In the context of building applications, DDD talks about problems as domains. It describes \\nindependent problem areas as Bounded Contexts (each Bounded Context correlates to a \\nmicroservice), and emphasizes a common language to talk about these problems. It also suggests \\nmany technical concepts and patterns, like domain entities with rich models (no anemic-domain \\nmodel), value objects, aggregates, and aggregate root (or root entity) rules to support the interna l \\nimplementation. This section introduces the design and implementation of those internal patterns.  \\nSometimes these DDD technical rules and patterns are perceived as obstacles that have a steep \\nlearning curve for implementing DDD approaches. But the important part is not the patterns \\nthemselves, but organizing the code so it is aligned to the business problems, and using the same \\nbusiness terms (ubiquitous language). In addition, DDD approaches should be applied only if you are \\nimplementing complex microservices with significant business rules. Simpler responsibilities, like a \\nCRUD service, can be managed with simpler approaches. \\nWhere to draw the boundaries is the key task when designing and defining a microservice. DDD \\npatterns help you understand the complexity in the domain. For the domain model for each Bounded \\nContext, you identify and define the entities, value objects, and aggregates that model your domain. \\nYou build and refine a domain model that is contained within a boundary that defines your conte xt. \\nAnd that is explicit in the form of a microservice. The components within those boundaries end up \\nbeing your microservices, although in some cases a BC or business microservices can be composed of \\nseveral physical services. DDD is about boundaries and so are microservices. \\nKeep the microservice context boundaries relatively small \\nDetermining where to place boundaries between Bounded Contexts balances two competing goals. \\nFirst, you want to initially create the smallest possible microservices, although t hat should not be the \\nmain driver; you should create a boundary around things that need cohesion. Second, you want to \\navoid chatty communications between microservices. These goals can contradict one another. You \\nshould balance them by decomposing the system into as many small microservices as you can until \\nyou see communication boundaries growing quickly with each additional attempt to separate a new \\nBounded Context. Cohesion is key within a single bounded context. \\nIt is similar to the Inappropriate Intimacy code smell when implementing classes. If two microservices \\nneed to collaborate a lot with each other, they should probably be the same microservice.  \\nAnother way to look at this aspect is autonomy. If a microservice must rely on another service to \\ndirectly service a request, it is not truly autonomous.'),\n",

The point here is that the domain entity is contained within the domain  \\nmodel layer and should not be propagated to other areas that it does not belong to, like to the \\npresentation layer. \\nAdditionally, you need to have always-valid entities (see the Designing validations in the domain \\nmodel layer section) controlled by aggregate roots (root entities). Therefore, entities should not be \\nbound to client views, because at the UI level some data might still not be validated. This reason is \\nwhat the ViewModel is for. The ViewModel is a data model exclusively for presentation layer needs. \\nThe domain entities do not belong directly to the ViewModel. Instead, you need to translate betwe en \\nViewModels and domain entities and vice versa. \\nWhen tackling complexity, it is important to have a domain model controlled by aggregate roots that \\nmake sure that all the invariants and rules related to that group of entities (aggregate) are performed \\nthrough a single entry-point or gate, the aggregate root. \\nFigure 7-5 shows how a layered design is implemented in the eShopOnContainers application.  \\n \\nFigure 7-5.

Each layer is a VS project: Application layer is \\nOrdering.API, Domain layer is Ordering.Domain and the Infrastructure layer is Ordering.Infrastructure. \\nYou want to design the system so that each layer communicates only with certain othe r layers. That \\napproach may be easier to enforce if layers are implemented as different class libraries, because you \\ncan clearly identify what dependencies are set between libraries. For instance, the domain model layer \\nshould not take a dependency on any other layer (the domain model classes should be Plain Old Class \\nObjects, or POCO, classes). As shown in Figure 7-6, the Ordering.Domain layer library has \\ndependencies only on the .NET libraries or NuGet packages, but not on any other custom library, such \\nas data library or persistence library. \\n \\nFigure 7-6. Layers implemented as libraries allow better control of dependencies between layers \\nThe domain model layer \\nEric Evans’s excellent book Domain Driven Design says the following about the domain model layer \\nand the application layer. \\nDomain Model Layer: Responsible for representing concepts of the business, information about the \\nbusiness situation, and business rules. State that reflects the business situation is controlled and used \\nhere, even though the technical details of storing it are delegated to the infrastructure. This layer is \\nthe heart of business software. \\nThe domain model layer is where the business is expressed. When you implement a microservice \\ndomain model layer in .NET, that layer is coded as a class library with the domain entities that capture \\ndata plus behavior (methods with logic). \\nFollowing the Persistence Ignorance and the Infrastructure Ignorance principles, this layer must \\ncompletely ignore data persistence details. These persistence tasks should be performed by the \\ninfrastructure layer. Therefore, this layer should not take direct dependencies on the infrastructure, \\nwhich means that an important rule is that your domain model entity classes should be POCOs.  \\nDomain entities should not have any direct dependency (like deriving from a base class) on any data \\naccess infrastructure framework like Entity Framework or NHibernate. Ideally, your domain entities \\nshould not derive from or implement any type defined in any infrastructure framework.  \\nMost modern ORM frameworks like Entity Framework Core allow this approach, so that your domain \\nmodel classes are not coupled to the infrastructure. However, having POCO entities is not always \\npossible when using certain NoSQL databases and frameworks, like Actors and Reliable Collections in \\nAzure Service Fabric. \\nEven when it is important to follow the Persistence Ignorance principle for your Domain model, you \\nshould not ignore persistence concerns. It is still important to understand the physical data model and \\nhow it maps to your entity object model. Otherwise you can create impossible designs.'),\n",

In some entity models, the model might fit, but \\nusually it does not. There are still constraints that your entity model must adhere to, based both on \\nthe storage technology and ORM technology. \\nThe application layer \\nMoving on to the application layer, we can again cite Eric Evans’s book Domain Driven Design: \\nApplication Layer: Defines the jobs the software is supposed to do and directs the expressive domain \\nobjects to work out problems. The tasks this layer is responsible for are meaningful to the business or \\nnecessary for interaction with the application layers of other systems. This layer is kept thin. It does \\nnot contain business rules or knowledge, but only coordinates tasks and delegates work to \\ncollaborations of domain objects in the next layer down. It does not have state reflecting the business \\nsituation, but it can have state that reflects the progress of a task for the user or the program.  \\nA microservice’s application layer in .NET is commonly coded as an ASP.NET Core Web API project. \\nThe project implements the microservice’s interaction, remote network access, and the external Web \\nAPIs used from the UI or client apps. It includes queries if using a CQRS approach, commands \\naccepted by the microservice, and even the event-driven communication between microservices \\n(integration events). The ASP.NET Core Web API that represents the application layer must not contain \\nbusiness rules or domain knowledge (especially domain rules for transactions or updates); these \\nshould be owned by the domain model class library. The application layer must only coordinate tasks \\nand must not hold or define any domain state (domain model). It delegates the execution of business \\nrules to the domain model classes themselves (aggregate roots and domain entities), which will \\nultimately update the data within those domain entities. \\nBasically, the application logic is where you implement all use cases that depend on a given front end. \\nFor example, the implementation related to a Web API service. \\nThe goal is that the domain logic in the domain model layer, its invariants, the data model, and \\nrelated business rules must be completely independent from the presentation and application layers. \\nMost of all, the domain model layer must not directly depend on any infrastructure framework.  \\nThe infrastructure layer \\nThe infrastructure layer is how the data that is initially held in domain entities (in memory) is persisted \\nin databases or another persistent store. An example is using Entity Framework Core code to \\nimplement the Repository pattern classes that use a DBContext to persist data in a relational \\ndatabase. \\nIn accordance with the previously mentioned Persistence Ignorance and Infrastructure Ignorance \\nprinciples, the infrastructure layer must not “contaminate” the domain model layer. You must keep the \\ndomain model entity classes agnostic from the infrastructure that you use to persist data (EF or any \\nother framework) by not taking hard dependencies on frameworks. Your domain model layer class \\nlibrary should have only your domain code, just POCO entity classes implementing the heart of your \\nsoftware and completely decoupled from infrastructure technologies.'),\n",

As Eric Evans says, “an \\nobject primarily defined by its identity is called an Entity.” Entities are very important in the domain \\nmodel, since they are the base for a model. Therefore, you should identify and design them carefully. \\nAn entity’s identity can cross multiple microservices or Bounded Contexts. \\nThe same identity (that is, the same Id value, although perhaps not the same domain entity) can be \\nmodeled across multiple Bounded Contexts or microservices. However, that does not imply that the \\nsame entity, with the same attributes and logic would be implemented in multiple Bounded Contexts. \\nInstead, entities in each Bounded Context limit their attributes and behaviors to those required in that \\nBounded Context’s domain. \\nFor instance, the buyer entity might have most of a person’s attributes that are defined in the user \\nentity in the profile or identity microservice, including the identity. But the buyer entity in the ordering \\nmicroservice might have fewer attributes, because only certain buyer data is related to the order \\nprocess. The context of each microservice or Bounded Context impacts its domain model.  \\nDomain entities must implement behavior in addition to implementing data attributes.  \\nA domain entity in DDD must implement the domain logic or behavior related to the entity data (the \\nobject accessed in memory). For example, as part of an order entity class you must have business logic \\nand operations implemented as methods for tasks such as adding an order item, data validation, and \\ntotal calculation. The entity’s methods take care of the invariants and rules of the entity instead of \\nhaving those rules spread across the application layer. \\nFigure 7-8 shows a domain entity that implements not only data attributes but operations or methods \\nwith related domain logic. \\n \\nFigure 7-8.

There \\nare objects, many named after the nouns in the domain space, and these objects are connected with \\nthe rich relationships and structure that true domain models have. The catch comes when you look at \\nthe behavior, and you realize that there is hardly any behavior on these objects, making them little \\nmore than bags of getters and setters. \\nOf course, when you use an anemic domain model, those data models will be used from a set of \\nservice objects (traditionally named the business layer) which capture all the domain or business logic. \\nThe business layer sits on top of the data model and uses the data model just as data.  \\nThe anemic domain model is just a procedural style design. Anemic entity objects are not real objects \\nbecause they lack behavior (methods). They only hold data properties and thus it is not object -\\noriented design. By putting all the behavior out into service objects (the business layer), you \\nessentially end up with spaghetti code or transaction scripts, and therefore you lose the advantages \\nthat a domain model provides. \\nRegardless, if your microservice or Bounded Context is very simple (a CRUD service), the anemic \\ndomain model in the form of entity objects with just data properties might be good enough, and it \\nmight not be worth implementing more complex DDD patterns. In that case, it will be simply a \\npersistence model, because you have intentionally created an entity with only data for CRUD \\npurposes. \\nThat is why microservices architectures are perfect for a multi-architectural approach depending on \\neach Bounded Context. For instance, in eShopOnContainers, the ordering microserv ice implements \\nDDD patterns, but the catalog microservice, which is a simple CRUD service, does not.  \\nSome people say that the anemic domain model is an anti-pattern. It really depends on what you are \\nimplementing. If the microservice you are creating is simple enough (for example, a CRUD service), \\nfollowing the anemic domain model it is not an anti-pattern. However, if you need to tackle the \\ncomplexity of a microservice’s domain that has a lot of ever-changing business rules, the anemic \\ndomain model might be an anti-pattern for that microservice or Bounded Context. In that case, \\ndesigning it as a rich model with entities containing data plus behavior as well as implementing \\nadditional DDD patterns (aggregates, value objects, etc.) might have huge benefits fo r the long-term \\nsuccess of such a microservice. \\nAdditional resources \\n• DevIQ.

The Anemic Domain Model \\nhttps://martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html \\nThe Value Object pattern \\nAs Eric Evans has noted, “Many objects do not have conceptual identity. These objects describe \\ncertain characteristics of a thing.” \\nAn entity requires an identity, but there are many objects in a system that do not, like the Value \\nObject pattern. A value object is an object with no conceptual identity that describes a domain aspect. \\nThese are objects that you instantiate to represent design elements that only concern you tempora rily. \\nYou care about what they are, not who they are. Examples include numbers and strings, but can also \\nbe higher-level concepts like groups of attributes. \\nSomething that is an entity in a microservice might not be an entity in another microservice, becau se \\nin the second case, the Bounded Context might have a different meaning. For example, an address in \\nan e-commerce application might not have an identity at all, since it might only represent a group of \\nattributes of the customer’s profile for a person or company. In this case, the address should be \\nclassified as a value object. However, in an application for an electric power utility company, the \\ncustomer address could be important for the business domain. Therefore, the address must have an \\nidentity so the billing system can be directly linked to the address. In that case, an address should be \\nclassified as a domain entity. \\nA person with a name and surname is usually an entity because a person has identity, even if the \\nname and surname coincide with another set of values, such as if those names also refer to a different \\nperson. \\nValue objects are hard to manage in relational databases and ORMs like Entity Framework (EF), \\nwhereas in document-oriented databases they are easier to implement and use. \\nEF Core 2.0 and later versions include the Owned Entities feature that makes it easier to handle value \\nobjects, as we’ll see in detail later on. \\nAdditional resources \\n• Martin Fowler.

A more fine-grained DDD unit is \\nthe aggregate, which describes a cluster or group of entities and behaviors that can be treated as a \\ncohesive unit. \\nYou usually define an aggregate based on the transactions that you need. A classic example is an \\norder that also contains a list of order items. An order item will usually be an entity.  But it will be a \\nchild entity within the order aggregate, which will also contain the order entity as its root entity, \\ntypically called an aggregate root. \\nIdentifying aggregates can be hard. An aggregate is a group of objects that must be consistent \\ntogether, but you cannot just pick a group of objects and label them an aggregate. You must start \\nwith a domain concept and think about the entities that are used in the most common transactions \\nrelated to that concept. Those entities that need to be transactionally consistent are what forms an \\naggregate. Thinking about transaction operations is probably the best way to identify aggregates.  \\nThe Aggregate Root or Root Entity pattern \\nAn aggregate is composed of at least one entity: the aggregate root, also called root entity or primary \\nentity. Additionally, it can have multiple child entities and value objects, with all entities and objects \\nworking together to implement required behavior and transactions. \\nThe purpose of an aggregate root is to ensure the consistency of the aggregate; it should be the only \\nentry point for updates to the aggregate through methods or operations in the aggregate root class. \\nYou should make changes to entities within the aggregate only via the aggregate root. It is the \\naggregate’s consistency guardian, considering all the invariants and consistency rules you might need \\nto comply with in your aggregate. If you change a child entity or value object independently, the \\naggregate root cannot ensure that the aggregate is in a valid state. It would be like a table with a \\nloose leg. Maintaining consistency is the main purpose of the aggregate root.  \\nIn Figure 7-9, you can see sample aggregates like the buyer aggregate, which contains a single entity \\n(the aggregate root Buyer). The order aggregate contains multiple entities and a value object.'),\n",

(WRONG) Accessing the OrderItems collection directly from the application layer // or \\ncommand handlers \\nmyOrder.OrderItems.Add(myNewOrderItem); \\n//... \\nIn this case, the Add method is purely an operation to add data, with direct access to the OrderItems \\ncollection. Therefore, most of the domain logic, rules, or validations related to that operation with the \\nchild entities will be spread across the application layer (command handlers and Web API controllers). \\nIf you go around the aggregate root, the aggregate root cannot guarantee its invariants, its validity, or \\nits consistency. Eventually you will have spaghetti code or transactional script code.  \\nTo follow DDD patterns, entities must not have public setters in any entity property. Changes in an \\nentity should be driven by explicit methods with explicit ubiquitous language about the change they \\nare performing in the entity. \\nFurthermore, collections within the entity (like the order items) should be read-only properties (the \\nAsReadOnly method explained later). You should be able to update it only from within the aggregate \\nroot class methods or the child entity methods. \\nAs you can see in the code for the Order aggregate root, all setters should be private or at least read-\\nonly externally, so that any operation against the entity’s data or its child entities has to be performed \\nthrough methods in the entity class. This maintains consistency in a controlled and object -oriented \\nway instead of implementing transactional script code. \\nThe following code snippet shows the proper way to code the task of adding an OrderItem object to \\nthe Order aggregate. \\n// RIGHT ACCORDING TO DDD--CODE AT THE APPLICATION LAYER OR COMMAND HANDLERS \\n// The code in command handlers or WebAPI controllers, related only to application stuff \\n// There is NO code here related to OrderItem object's business logic \\nmyOrder.AddOrderItem(productId, productName, pictureUrl, unitPrice, discount, units); \\n \\n// The code related to OrderItem params validations or domain rules should \\n// be WITHIN the AddOrderItem method. \\n \\n//... \\nIn this snippet, most of the validations or logic related to the creation of an OrderItem object will be \\nunder the control of the Order aggregate root—in the AddOrderItem method—especially validations \\nand logic related to other elements in the aggregate.

This principle applies to any other domain logic for the OrderItem object. \\nIn addition, the new OrderItem(params) operation will also be controlled and performed by the \\nAddOrderItem method from the Order aggregate root. Therefore, most of the logic or validations \\nrelated to that operation (especially anything that impacts the consistency between other child \\nentities) will be in a single place within the aggregate root. That is the ultimate purpose of the \\naggregate root pattern. \\nWhen you use Entity Framework Core 1.1 or later, a DDD entity can be better expressed because it \\nallows mapping to fields in addition to properties. This is useful when protecting collections of child \\nentities or value objects. With this enhancement, you can use simple private fields instead of \\nproperties and you can implement any update to the field collection in public methods  and provide \\nread-only access through the AsReadOnly method. \\nIn DDD, you want to update the entity only through methods in the entity (or the constructor) in order \\nto control any invariant and the consistency of the data, so properties are defined only wit h a get \\naccessor. The properties are backed by private fields. Private members can only be accessed from \\nwithin the class. However, there is one exception: EF Core needs to set these fields as well (so it can \\nreturn the object with the proper values). \\nMap properties with only get accessors to the fields in the database table \\nMapping properties to database table columns is not a domain responsibility but part of the \\ninfrastructure and persistence layer. We mention this here just so you are aware of the new \\ncapabilities in EF Core 1.1 or later related to how you can model entities. Additional details on this \\ntopic are explained in the infrastructure and persistence section. \\nWhen you use EF Core 1.0 or later, within the DbContext you need to map the properties that are \\ndefined only with getters to the actual fields in the database table. This is done with the HasField \\nmethod of the PropertyBuilder class. \\nMap fields without properties \\nWith the feature in EF Core 1.1 or later to map columns to fields, it is also possible to not use \\nproperties. Instead, you can just map columns from a table to fields. A common use case for this is \\nprivate fields for an internal state that does not need to be accessed from outside the entity.  \\nFor example, in the preceding OrderAggregate code example, there are several private fields, like the \\n_paymentMethodId field, that have no related property for either a setter or getter. That field could \\nalso be calculated within the order’s business logic and used from the order’s methods, but it needs \\nto be persisted in the database as well. So in EF Core (since v1.1) there is a way to map a field without \\na related property to a column in the database. This is also explained in the Infrastructure layer section \\nof this guide.'),\n",

If you didn’t \\nchoose to overload the == and != operators, then the last comparison of one == two would evaluate \\nas false. For more information, see Overload ValueObject equality operators. \\nHow to persist value objects in the database with EF Core 2.0 and later \\nYou just saw how to define a value object in your domain model. But how can you actually persist it \\ninto the database using Entity Framework Core since it usually targets entities with identity?  \\nBackground and older approaches using EF Core 1.1 \\nAs background, a limitation when using EF Core 1.0 and 1.1 was that you could not use complex types \\nas defined in EF 6.x in the traditional .NET Framework. Therefore, if using EF Core 1.0 or 1.1, you \\nneeded to store your value object as an EF entity with an ID field. Then, so it looked mo re like a value \\nobject with no identity, you could hide its ID so you make clear that the identity of a value object is \\nnot important in the domain model. You could hide that ID by using the ID as a shadow property. \\nSince that configuration for hiding the ID in the model is set up in the EF infrastr ucture level, it would \\nbe kind of transparent for your domain model. \\nIn the initial version of eShopOnContainers (.NET Core 1.1), the hidden ID needed by EF Core \\ninfrastructure was implemented in the following way in the DbContext level, using Fluent API a t the \\ninfrastructure project. Therefore, the ID was hidden from the domain model point of view, but still \\npresent in the infrastructure. \\n// Old approach with EF Core 1.1 \\n// Fluent API within the OrderingContext:DbContext in the Infrastructure project \\nvoid ConfigureAddress(EntityTypeBuilder<Address> addressConfiguration) \\n{ \\n    addressConfiguration.ToTable(\"address\", DEFAULT_SCHEMA); \\n \\n    addressConfiguration.Property<int>(\"Id\")  // Id is a shadow property \\n        .IsRequired(); \\n    addressConfiguration.HasKey(\"Id\");   // Id is a shadow property \\n}'),\n",

You can see \\nlimitations at the end of this section. \\nThe owned entity type feature was added to EF Core since version 2.0. \\nAn owned entity type allows you to map types that do not have their own identity explicitly defined in \\nthe domain model and are used as properties, such as a value object, within any of your entities. An \\nowned entity type shares the same CLR type with another entity type (that is, it’s just a regular class). \\nThe entity containing the defining navigation is the owner entity. When querying the owner, the \\nowned types are included by default. \\nJust by looking at the domain model, an owned type looks like it doesn’t have any identity. However, \\nunder the covers, owned types do have the identity, but the owner navigation pro perty is part of this \\nidentity. \\nThe identity of instances of owned types is not completely their own. It consists of three components:  \\n• The identity of the owner \\n• The navigation property pointing to them \\n• In the case of collections of owned types, an independent component (supported in EF Core 2.2 \\nand later). \\nFor example, in the Ordering domain model at eShopOnContainers, as part of the Order entity, the \\nAddress value object is implemented as an owned entity type within the owner entity, which is the \\nOrder entity. Address is a type with no identity property defined in the domain model. It is used as a \\nproperty of the Order type to specify the shipping address for a particular order.  \\nBy convention, a shadow primary key is created for the owned type and it will be mapped to the same \\ntable as the owner by using table splitting. This allows to use owned types similarly to how complex \\ntypes are used in EF6 in the traditional .NET Framework. \\nIt is important to note that owned types are never discovered by convention in EF Core, so you have \\nto declare them explicitly. \\nIn eShopOnContainers, in the OrderingContext.cs file, within the OnModelCreating() method, \\nmultiple infrastructure configurations are applied.

Therefore, the internal properties of Address will \\nappear in the Orders table with the names Address_Street, Address_City (and so on for State, \\nCountry, and ZipCode). \\nYou can append the Property().HasColumnName() fluent method to rename those columns.

There are multiple ways to implement validations, such as verifying data and raising exceptions \\nif the validation fails. There are also more advanced patterns such as using the Specification pattern \\nfor validations, and the Notification pattern to return a collection of errors instead of returning an \\nexception for each validation as it occurs. \\nValidate conditions and throw exceptions \\nThe following code example shows the simplest approach to validation in a domain entity by raising \\nan exception. In the references table at the end of this section you can see links to more advanced \\nimplementations based on the patterns we have discussed previously. \\npublic void SetAddress(Address address) \\n{ \\n    _shippingAddress = address?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(address)); \\n} \\nA better example would demonstrate the need to ensure that either the internal state did not change, \\nor that all the mutations for a method occurred. For example, the following implementation would \\nleave the object in an invalid state: \\npublic void SetAddress(string line1, string line2, \\n    string city, string state, int zip) \\n{ \\n    _shippingAddress.line1 = line1 ?? throw new ... \\n    _shippingAddress.line2 = line2; \\n    _shippingAddress.city = city ?? throw new ... \\n    _shippingAddress.state = (IsValid(state) ? state : throw new …); \\n} \\nIf the value of the state is invalid, the first address line and the city have already been changed.

In that case, validation will occur upon model binding, just \\nbefore invoking the action and you can check the controller’s ModelState.IsValid property to check \\nthe result, but then again, it happens in the controller, not before persisting the entity object in the \\nDbContext, as it had done since EF 4.x. \\nYou can still implement custom validation in the entity class using data annotations and the \\nIValidatableObject.Validate method, by overriding the DbContext’s SaveChanges method.  \\nYou can see a sample implementation for validating IValidatableObject entities in this comment on \\nGitHub. That sample doesn’t do attribute-based validations, but they should be easy to implement \\nusing reflection in the same override. \\nHowever, from a DDD point of view, the domain model is best kept lean with the use of exceptions in \\nyour entity’s behavior methods, or by implementing the Specification and Notification patterns to \\nenforce validation rules. \\nIt can make sense to use data annotations at the application layer in ViewModel classes (instead of \\ndomain entities) that will accept input, to allow for model validation within the UI layer.

In other words, \\nand using DDD terminology, use domain events to explicitly implement side effects across multiple \\naggregates. Optionally, for better scalability and less impact in database locks, use eventual \\nconsistency between aggregates within the same domain. \\nWhat is a domain event? \\nAn event is something that has happened in the past. A domain event is, something that happened in \\nthe domain that you want other parts of the same domain (in-process) to be aware of. The notified \\nparts usually react somehow to the events. \\nAn important benefit of domain events is that side effects can be expressed explicitly.  \\nFor example, if you’re just using Entity Framework and there has to be a reaction to some event, you \\nwould probably code whatever you need close to what triggers the event. So the rule gets coupled, \\nimplicitly, to the code, and you have to look into the code to, hopefully, realize the rule is \\nimplemented there. \\nOn the other hand, using domain events makes the concept explicit, because there is a DomainEvent \\nand at least one DomainEventHandler involved. \\nFor example, in the eShopOnContainers application, when an order is created, the user becomes a \\nbuyer, so an OrderStartedDomainEvent is raised and handled in the \\nValidateOrAddBuyerAggregateWhenOrderStartedDomainEventHandler, so the underlying concept is \\nevident. \\nIn short, domain events help you to express, explicitly, the domain rules, based in the ubiquitous \\nlanguage provided by the domain experts. Domain events also enable a better separation of concerns \\namong classes within the same domain. \\nIt’s important to ensure that, just like a database transaction, either all the operations related to a \\ndomain event finish successfully or none of them do. \\nDomain events are similar to messaging-style events, with one important difference. With real \\nmessaging, message queuing, message brokers, or a service bus using AMQP, a message is always \\nsent asynchronously and communicated across processes and machines. This is useful for integrating \\nmultiple Bounded Contexts, microservices, or even different applications. However, with domain \\nevents, you want to raise an event from the domain operation you are currently running, but you want \\nany side effects to occur within the same domain. \\nThe domain events and their side effects (the actions triggered afterwards that are managed by event \\nhandlers) should occur almost immediately, usually in-process, and within the same domain. Thus, \\ndomain events could be synchronous or asynchronous. Integration events, however, should always be \\nasynchronous.'),\n",

However, their implementation must be different. Domain events are just messages \\npushed to a domain event dispatcher, which could be implemented as an in-memory mediator based \\non an IoC container or any other method. \\nOn the other hand, the purpose of integration events is to propagate committed transactions and \\nupdates to additional subsystems, whether they are other microservices, Bounded Contexts or even \\nexternal applications.

When the user \\ninitiates an order, the Order Aggregate sends an OrderStarted domain event. The OrderStarted \\ndomain event is handled by the Buyer Aggregate to create a Buyer object in the ordering \\nmicroservice, based on the original user info from the identity microservice (with information provided \\nin the CreateOrder command). \\nAlternately, you can have the aggregate root subscribed for events raised by members of its \\naggregates (child entities). For instance, each OrderItem child entity can raise an event when the item \\nprice is higher than a specific amount, or when the product item amount is too high. The aggregate \\nroot can then receive those events and perform a global calculation or aggregation. \\nIt is important to understand that this event-based communication is not implemented directly within \\nthe aggregates; you need to implement domain event handlers. \\nHandling the domain events is an application concern. The domain model layer should only focus on \\nthe domain logic—things that a domain expert would understand, not application infrastructure like \\nhandlers and side-effect persistence actions using repositories. Therefore, the application layer level is \\nwhere you should have domain event handlers triggering actions when a domain event is raised.  \\nDomain events can also be used to trigger any number of application actions, and what is more \\nimportant, must be open to increase that number in the future in a decoupled way. For instance, when \\nthe order is started, you might want to publish a domain event to propagate that info to other \\naggregates or even to raise application actions like notifications. \\nThe key point is the open number of actions to be executed when a domain event occurs. Eventually, \\nthe actions and rules in the domain and application will grow. The complexity or number of side -\\neffect actions when something happens will grow, but if your code were coupled with “glue”  (that is, \\ncreating specific objects with new), then every time you needed to add a new action you would also \\nneed to change working and tested code. \\nThis change could result in new bugs and this approach also goes against the Open/Closed principle \\nfrom SOLID. Not only that, the original class that was orchestrating the operations would grow and \\ngrow, which goes against the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). \\nOn the other hand, if you use domain events, you can create a fine-grained and decoupled \\nimplementation by segregating responsibilities using this approach: \\n1. Send a command (for example, CreateOrder). \\n2. Receive the command in a command handler. \\n– Execute a single aggregate’s transaction. \\n– (Optional) Raise domain events for side effects (for example, OrderStartedDomainEvent). \\n3. Handle domain events (within the current process) that will execute an open number of side \\neffects in multiple aggregates or application actions.

This \\nmakes testing and debugging more difficult, because the event handlers with side -effects logic are \\nexecuted immediately after the event is raised. When you are testing and debugging, you just want to \\nfocus on what is happening in the current aggregate classes; you do not want to suddenly be \\nredirected to other event handlers for side effects related to other aggregates or application logic.  \\nThis is why other approaches have evolved, as explained in the next section. \\nThe deferred approach to raise and dispatch events \\nInstead of dispatching to a domain event handler immediately, a better approach is to add the \\ndomain events to a collection and then to dispatch those domain events right before or right after \\ncommitting the transaction (as with SaveChanges in EF). (This approach was described by Jimmy \\nBogard in this post A better domain events pattern.) \\nDeciding if you send the domain events right before or right after committing the transaction is \\nimportant, since it determines whether you will include the side effects as part of the same transaction \\nor in different transactions. In the latter case, you need to deal with eventual consistency across \\nmultiple aggregates. This topic is discussed in the next section. \\nThe deferred approach is what eShopOnContainers uses. First, you add the events happening in your \\nentities into a collection or list of events per entity. That list should be part of the entity object, or \\neven better, part of your base entity class, as shown in the following example of the Entity base class:  \\npublic abstract class Entity \\n{ \\n     //... \\n     private List<INotification> _domainEvents; \\n     public List<INotification> DomainEvents => _domainEvents; \\n \\n     public void AddDomainEvent(INotification eventItem) \\n     { \\n         _domainEvents = _domainEvents ?? new List<INotification>(); \\n         _domainEvents.Add(eventItem); \\n     } \\n \\n     public void RemoveDomainEvent(INotification eventItem) \\n     { \\n         _domainEvents?.Remove(eventItem); \\n     } \\n     //...

Part II: Making Aggregates Work \\nTogether: \\nThus, if executing a command on one aggregate instance requires that additional business rules \\nexecute on one or more aggregates, use eventual consistency […] There is a practical way to support \\neventual consistency in a DDD model. An aggregate method publishes a domain event that is in time \\ndelivered to one or more asynchronous subscribers. \\nThis rationale is based on embracing fine-grained transactions instead of transactions spanning many \\naggregates or entities. The idea is that in the second case, the number of database locks will be \\nsubstantial in large-scale applications with high scalability needs. Embracing the fact that highly \\nscalable applications need not have instant transactional consistency between multiple aggregates \\nhelps with accepting the concept of eventual consistency. Atomic changes are often not needed by \\nthe business, and it is in any case the responsibility of the domain experts to say wheth er particular \\noperations need atomic transactions or not. If an operation always needs an atomic transaction \\nbetween multiple aggregates, you might ask whether your aggregate should be larger or was not \\ncorrectly designed. \\nHowever, other developers and architects like Jimmy Bogard are okay with spanning a single \\ntransaction across several aggregates—but only when those additional aggregates are related to side \\neffects for the same original command. For instance, in A better domain events pattern, Bogard says \\nthis: \\nTypically, I want the side effects of a domain event to occur within the same logical transaction, but \\nnot necessarily in the same scope of raising the domain event […] Just before we commit our \\ntransaction, we dispatch our events to their respective handlers. \\nIf you dispatch the domain events right before committing the original transaction, it is because you \\nwant the side effects of those events to be included in the same transaction. For example, if the EF \\nDbContext SaveChanges method fails, the transaction will roll back all changes, including the result of \\nany side effect operations implemented by the related domain event handlers. This is because the \\nDbContext life scope is by default defined as “scoped.” Therefore, the DbContext object is shared \\nacross multiple repository objects being instantiated within the same scope or object graph. This \\ncoincides with the HttpRequest scope when developing Web API or MVC apps.  \\nActually, both approaches (single atomic transaction and eventual consistency) can be right. It really \\ndepends on your domain or business requirements and what the domain experts tell you. It also \\ndepends on how scalable you need the service to be (more granular transactions have less impact \\nwith regard to database locks). And it depends on how much investment you are willing to make in \\nyour code, since eventual consistency requires more complex code in order to detect possible \\ninconsistencies across aggregates and the need to implement compensatory actions. Consider that if \\nyou commit changes to the original aggregate and afterwards, when the events are being dispatched, \\nif there is an issue and the event handlers cannot commit their side effects, you will have \\ninconsistencies between aggregates. \\nA way to allow compensatory actions would be to store the domain events in additional database \\ntables so they can be part of the original transaction. Afterwards, you could have a batch process that \\ndetects inconsistencies and runs compensatory actions by comparing the list of events with the'),\n",

If you use an \\nObject-Relational Mapper (ORM) like Entity Framework, the code that must be implemented is \\nsimplified, thanks to LINQ and strong typing. This lets you focus on the data persistence logic rather \\nthan on data access plumbing. \\nThe Repository pattern is a well-documented way of working with a data source. In the book Patterns \\nof Enterprise Application Architecture, Martin Fowler describes a repository as follows: \\nA repository performs the tasks of an intermediary between the domain model layers and data \\nmapping, acting in a similar way to a set of domain objects in memory. Client objects declaratively \\nbuild queries and send them to the repositories for answers. Conceptually, a repository encapsulates a \\nset of objects stored in the database and operations that can be performed on them, providing a way \\nthat is closer to the persistence layer. Repositories, also, support the purpose of separating, clearly \\nand in one direction, the dependency between the work domain and the data allocation or mapping.  \\nDefine one repository per aggregate \\nFor each aggregate or aggregate root, you should create one repository class. In a micros ervice based \\non Domain-Driven Design (DDD) patterns, the only channel you should use to update the database \\nshould be the repositories. This is because they have a one-to-one relationship with the aggregate \\nroot, which controls the aggregate’s invariants and transactional consistency. It’s okay to query the \\ndatabase through other channels (as you can do following a CQRS approach), because queries don’t \\nchange the state of the database. However, the transactional area (that is, the updates) must always \\nbe controlled by the repositories and the aggregate roots. \\nBasically, a repository allows you to populate data in memory that comes from the database in the \\nform of the domain entities. Once the entities are in memory, they can be changed and then persisted \\nback to the database through transactions. \\nAs noted earlier, if you’re using the CQS/CQRS architectural pattern, the initial queries are performed \\nby side queries out of the domain model, performed by simple SQL statements using Dapper. This \\napproach is much more flexible than repositories because you can query and join any tables you \\nneed, and these queries aren’t restricted by rules from the aggregates. That data goes to the \\npresentation layer or client app. \\nIf the user makes changes, the data to be updated comes from the client app or presentation layer to \\nthe application layer (such as a Web API service). When you receive a command in a command \\nhandler, you use repositories to get the data you want to update from the database. You update it in \\nmemory with the data passed with the commands, and you then add or update the data (domain \\nentities) in the database through a transaction. \\nIt’s important to emphasize again that you should only define one repository for each aggregate root, \\nas shown in Figure 7-17. To achieve the goal of the aggregate root to maintain transactional \\nconsistency between all the objects within the aggregate, you should never create a repository for \\neach table in the database.'),\n",

That way, it’s explicit that you’re using a \\nrepository to target a specific aggregate. That can be easily done by implementing a generic \\nIRepository base interface, as in the following code: \\npublic interface IRepository<T> where T : IAggregateRoot \\n{ \\n    //.... \\n} \\nThe Repository pattern makes it easier to test your application logic \\nThe Repository pattern allows you to easily test your application with unit tests. Remember that unit \\ntests only test your code, not infrastructure, so the repository abstractions make it easier to achieve \\nthat goal. \\nAs noted in an earlier section, it’s recommended that you define and place the repository interfaces in \\nthe domain model layer so the application layer, such as your Web API microservice, doesn’t depend \\ndirectly on the infrastructure layer where you’ve implemented the actual repository classes. By doing \\nthis and using Dependency Injection in the controllers of your Web API, you can implement mock \\nrepositories that return fake data instead of data from the database. This decoupled approach allows \\nyou to create and run unit tests that focus the logic of your application without requiring connectivity \\nto the database. \\nConnections to databases can fail and, more importantly, running hundreds of tests against a \\ndatabase is bad for two reasons. First, it can take a long time because of the large number of tests. \\nSecond, the database records might change and impact the results of your tests, so that they might \\nnot be consistent. Testing against the database isn’t a unit test but an integration test. You should \\nhave many unit tests running fast, but fewer integration tests against the databases. \\nIn terms of separation of concerns for unit tests, your logic operates on domain entities in memory. It \\nassumes the repository class has delivered those. Once your logic modifies the domain entities, it \\nassumes the repository class will store them correctly. The important point here is to create unit tests \\nagainst your domain model and its domain logic. Aggregate roots are the main consistency \\nboundaries in DDD. \\nThe repositories implemented in eShopOnContainers rely on EF Core’s DbContext implem entation of \\nthe Repository and Unit of Work patterns using its change tracker, so they don’t duplicate this \\nfunctionality. \\nThe difference between the Repository pattern and the legacy Data Access class \\n(DAL class) pattern \\nA data access object directly performs data access and persistence operations against storage.

In simple terms, it means that for a specific user action, such as a registration on a website, \\nall the insert, update, and delete operations are handled in a single transaction. This is more efficient \\nthan handling multiple database transactions in a chattier way. \\nThese multiple persistence operations are performed later in a single action when your code from the \\napplication layer commands it. The decision about applying the in-memory changes to the actual \\ndatabase storage is typically based on the Unit of Work pattern. In EF, the Unit of Work pattern is \\nimplemented as the DbContext. \\nIn many cases, this pattern or way of applying operations against the storage can increase application \\nperformance and reduce the possibility of inconsistencies. It also reduces transaction blocking in the \\ndatabase tables, because all the intended operations are committed as part of one transaction. This is \\nmore efficient in comparison to executing many isolated operations against the database.

If you use POCO domain entities, your \\ndomain model classes are persistence-ignorant, following the Persistence Ignorance and the \\nInfrastructure Ignorance principles. \\nPer DDD patterns, you should encapsulate domain behavior and rules within the e ntity class itself, so \\nit can control invariants, validations, and rules when accessing any collection. Therefore, it is not a \\ngood practice in DDD to allow public access to collections of child entities or value objects. Instead, \\nyou want to expose methods that control how and when your fields and property collections can be \\nupdated, and what behavior and actions should occur when that happens. \\nSince EF Core 1.1, to satisfy those DDD requirements, you can have plain fields in your entities instead \\nof public properties. If you do not want an entity field to be externally accessible, you can just create \\nthe attribute or field instead of a property. You can also use private property setters. \\nIn a similar way, you can now have read-only access to collections by using a public property typed as \\nIReadOnlyCollection<T>, which is backed by a private field member for the collection (like a \\nList<T>) in your entity that relies on EF for persistence. Previous versions of Entity Framework \\nrequired collection properties to support ICollection<T>, which meant that any developer using the \\nparent entity class could add or remove items through its property collections. That possibility would \\nbe against the recommended patterns in DDD. \\nYou can use a private collection while exposing a read-only IReadOnlyCollection<T> object, as \\nshown in the following code example: \\npublic class Order : Entity \\n{ \\n    // Using private fields, allowed since EF Core 1.1 \\n    private DateTime _orderDate; \\n    // Other fields ... \\n \\n    private readonly List<OrderItem> _orderItems; \\n    public IReadOnlyCollection<OrderItem> OrderItems => _orderItems; \\n \\n    protected Order() { } \\n \\n    public Order(int buyerId, int paymentMethodId, Address address) \\n    { \\n        // Initializations ... \\n    } \\n \\n    public void AddOrderItem(int productId, string productName, \\n                             decimal unitPrice, decimal discount, \\n                             string pictureUrl, int units = 1) \\n    { \\n        // Validation logic... \\n \\n        var orderItem = new OrderItem(productId, productName, \\n                                      unitPrice, discount, \\n                                      pictureUrl, units); \\n        _orderItems.Add(orderItem); \\n    } \\n}'),\n",

In \\nthe following example of the OnModelCreating method from OrderingContext and the \\nOrderEntityTypeConfiguration class, the call to SetPropertyAccessMode tells EF Core to access the \\nOrderItems property through its field. \\n// At OrderingContext.cs from eShopOnContainers \\nprotected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder) \\n{ \\n   // ... \\n   modelBuilder.ApplyConfiguration(new OrderEntityTypeConfiguration()); \\n   // Other entities\\' configuration ... \\n} \\n \\n// At OrderEntityTypeConfiguration.cs from eShopOnContainers \\nclass OrderEntityTypeConfiguration : IEntityTypeConfiguration<Order> \\n{ \\n    public void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<Order> orderConfiguration) \\n    { \\n        orderConfiguration.ToTable(\"orders\", OrderingContext.DEFAULT_SCHEMA); \\n        // Other configuration \\n \\n        var navigation = \\n              orderConfiguration.Metadata.FindNavigation(nameof(Order.OrderItems)); \\n \\n        //EF access the OrderItem collection property through its backing field \\n        navigation.SetPropertyAccessMode(PropertyAccessMode.Field); \\n \\n        // Other configuration \\n    } \\n} \\nWhen you use fields instead of properties, the OrderItem entity is persisted as if it had a \\nList<OrderItem> property. However, it exposes a single accessor, the AddOrderItem method, for \\nadding new items to the order. As a result, behavior and data are tied together and will be consistent \\nthroughout any application code that uses the domain model. \\nImplement custom repositories with Entity Framework Core \\nAt the implementation level, a repository is simply a class with data persistence code coordinated by a \\nunit of work (DBContext in EF Core) when performing updates, as shown in the following class:  \\n// using directives... \\nnamespace Microsoft.eShopOnContainers.Services.Ordering.Infrastructure.Repositories \\n{ \\n    public class BuyerRepository : IBuyerRepository \\n    { \\n        private readonly OrderingContext _context; \\n        public IUnitOfWork UnitOfWork \\n        {'),\n",

Remember there is one-to-one relationship between an aggregate \\nand its related repository. Consider that an aggregate root entity object might have embedded child \\nentities within its EF graph. For example, a buyer might have multiple payment methods as related \\nchild entities. \\nSince the approach for the ordering microservice in eShopOnContainers is also based on CQS/CQRS, \\nmost of the queries are not implemented in custom repositories. Developers have the freedom to \\ncreate the queries and joins they need for the presentation layer without the restrictions imposed by \\naggregates, custom repositories per aggregate, and DDD in general. Most of the custom repositories \\nsuggested by this guide have several update or transactional methods but just the query methods \\nneeded to get data to be updated. For example, the BuyerRepository repository implements a \\nFindAsync method, because the application needs to know whether a particular buyer exists before \\ncreating a new buyer related to the order.'),\n",

The Unit of Work and \\nRepository patterns result in the simplest code, as in the CRUD catalog microservice in \\neShopOnContainers.

Implementing these patterns can facilitate the use of mock repositories simulating \\naccess to the database. \\nIn Figure 7-18, you can see the differences between not using repositories (directly using the EF \\nDbContext) versus using repositories, which makes it easier to mock those repositories.  \\n \\nFigure 7-18.

If you run tests that also access the actual database through the Entity \\nFramework, they are not unit tests but integration tests, which are a lot slower. \\nIf you were using DbContext directly, you would have to mock it or to run unit tests by using an in -\\nmemory SQL Server with predictable data for unit tests. But mocking the DbContext or controlling  \\nfake data requires more work than mocking at the repository level. Of course, you could always test \\nthe MVC controllers. \\nEF DbContext and IUnitOfWork instance lifetime in your IoC container \\nThe DbContext object (exposed as an IUnitOfWork object) should be shared among multiple \\nrepositories within the same HTTP request scope. For example, this is true when the operation being \\nexecuted must deal with multiple aggregates, or simply because you are using multiple repository \\ninstances. It is also important to mention that the IUnitOfWork interface is part of your domain layer, \\nnot an EF Core type. \\nIn order to do that, the instance of the DbContext object has to have its service lifetime set to \\nServiceLifetime.Scoped. This is the default lifetime when registering a DbContext with \\nservices.AddDbContext in your IoC container from the ConfigureServices method of the Startup.cs \\nfile in your ASP.NET Core Web API project. The following code illustrates this.  \\npublic IServiceProvider ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) \\n{ \\n    // Add framework services. \\n    services.AddMvc(options => \\n    { \\n        options.Filters.Add(typeof(HttpGlobalExceptionFilter)); \\n    }).AddControllersAsServices(); \\n \\n    services.AddEntityFrameworkSqlServer() \\n      .AddDbContext<OrderingContext>(options => \\n      { \\n          options.UseSqlServer(Configuration[\"ConnectionString\"], \\n                               sqlOptions => \\nsqlOptions.MigrationsAssembly(typeof(Startup).GetTypeInfo(). \\n                                                                                    \\nAssembly.GetName().Name)); \\n      }, \\n      ServiceLifetime.Scoped // Note that Scoped is the default choice \\n                             // in AddDbContext.

Previously you \\nsaw how domain entities (for example, a product or order domain) can be used to generate a related \\ndatabase schema. EF is strongly designed around the concept of conventions. Conventions address \\nquestions like “What will the name of a table be?” or “What property is the primary key?” Conventions \\nare typically based on conventional names. For example, it is typical for the primary key to be a \\nproperty that ends with Id. \\nBy convention, each entity will be set up to map to a table with the same name as the \\nDbSet<TEntity> property that exposes the entity on the derived context. If no DbSet<TEntity> value \\nis provided for the given entity, the class name is used. \\nData Annotations versus Fluent API \\nThere are many additional EF Core conventions, and most of them can be changed by using either \\ndata annotations or Fluent API, implemented within the OnModelCreating method.  \\nData annotations must be used on the entity model classes themselves, which is a more intrusive way \\nfrom a DDD point of view. This is because you are contaminating your model with data annotations \\nrelated to the infrastructure database. On the other hand, Fluent API is a convenien t way to change \\nmost conventions and mappings within your data persistence infrastructure layer, so the entity model \\nwill be clean and decoupled from the persistence infrastructure.'),\n",

If you implemented your domain model based on \\nPOCO entity classes, agnostic to the infrastructure persistence, it might look like you could move to a \\ndifferent persistence infrastructure, even from relational to NoSQL. However, that should not be your \\ngoal. There are always constraints and trade-offs in the different database technologies, so you will \\nnot be able to have the same model for relational or NoSQL databases. Changing persistence models \\nis not a trivial task, because transactions and persistence operations will be very different.  \\nFor example, in a document-oriented database, it is okay for an aggregate root to have multiple child \\ncollection properties. In a relational database, querying multiple child collection properties is not \\neasily optimized, because you get a UNION ALL SQL statement back from EF. Having the same \\ndomain model for relational databases or NoSQL databases is not simple, and you should not try to \\ndo it. You really have to design your model with an understanding of how the data is going to be \\nused in each particular database. \\nA benefit when using NoSQL databases is that the entities are more denormalized, so you do not set a \\ntable mapping. Your domain model can be more flexible than when using a relational database. \\nWhen you design your domain model based on aggregates, moving to NoSQL and document -\\noriented databases might be even easier than using a relational database, because the aggregates \\nyou design are similar to serialized documents in a document-oriented database. Then you can \\ninclude in those “bags” all the information you might need for that aggregate.  \\nFor instance, the following JSON code is a sample implementation of an order aggregate when using \\na document-oriented database. It is similar to the order aggregate we implemented in the \\neShopOnContainers sample, but without using EF Core underneath. \\n{ \\n    \"id\": \"2017001\", \\n    \"orderDate\": \"2/25/2017\", \\n    \"buyerId\": \"1234567\", \\n    \"address\": [ \\n        { \\n        \"street\": \"100 One Microsoft Way\", \\n        \"city\": \"Redmond\", \\n        \"state\": \"WA\", \\n        \"zip\": \"98052\", \\n        \"country\": \"U.S.\" \\n        } \\n    ], \\n    \"orderItems\": [ \\n        {\"id\": 20170011, \"productId\": \"123456\", \"productName\": \".NET T-Shirt\", \\n        \"unitPrice\": 25, \"units\": 2, \"discount\": 0}, \\n        {\"id\": 20170012, \"productId\": \"123457\", \"productName\": \".NET Mug\", \\n        \"unitPrice\": 15, \"units\": 1, \"discount\": 0} \\n    ] \\n} \\nIntroduction to Azure Cosmos DB and the native Cosmos DB API \\nAzure Cosmos DB is Microsoft’s globally distributed database service for mission-critical applications. \\nAzure Cosmos DB provides turn-key global distribution, elastic scaling of throughput and storage'),\n",

SOLID is an acronym that groups five \\nfundamental principles: \\n• Single Responsibility principle \\n• Open/closed principle \\n• Liskov substitution principle \\n• Interface Segregation principle \\n• Dependency Inversion principle \\nSOLID is more about how you design your application or microservice internal layers and about \\ndecoupling dependencies between them. It is not related to the domain, but to the application’s \\ntechnical design. The final principle, the Dependency Inversion principle, allows you to decouple the \\ninfrastructure layer from the rest of the layers, which allows a better decoupled implementation of the  \\nDDD layers. \\nDependency Injection (DI) is one way to implement the Dependency Inversion principle. It is a \\ntechnique for achieving loose coupling between objects and their dependencies. Rather than directly \\ninstantiating collaborators, or using static references (that is, using new…), the objects that a class \\nneeds in order to perform its actions are provided to (or “injected into”) the class. Most often, classes \\nwill declare their dependencies via their constructor, allowing them to follow the Explicit \\nDependencies principle. Dependency Injection is usually based on specific Inversion of Control (IoC) \\ncontainers. ASP.NET Core provides a simple built-in IoC container, but you can also use your favorite \\nIoC container, like Autofac or Ninject. \\nBy following the SOLID principles, your classes will tend naturally to be small, well-factored, and easily \\ntested. But how can you know if too many dependencies are being injected into your classes? If you \\nuse DI through the constructor, it will be easy to detect that by just looking at the number of \\nparameters for your constructor. If there are too many dependencies, this is generally a sign (a code \\nsmell) that your class is trying to do too much, and is probably violating the Single Responsibility \\nprinciple. \\nIt would take another guide to cover SOLID in detail. Therefore, this guide requires you to have only a \\nminimum knowledge of these topics. \\nAdditional resources \\n• SOLID: Fundamental OOP Principles \\nhttps://deviq.com/solid/'),\n",

The application layer in the Ordering.API ASP.NET Core Web API project \\nASP.NET Core includes a simple built-in IoC container (represented by the IServiceProvider interface) \\nthat supports constructor injection by default, and ASP.NET makes certain services available through \\nDI. ASP.NET Core uses the term service for any of the types you register that will be injected through \\nDI. You configure the built-in container’s services in the ConfigureServices method in your'),\n",

In a simple Web \\nAPI (for example, the catalog microservice in eShopOnContainers), you inject them at the MVC \\ncontrollers’ level, in a controller constructor, as part of the request pipeline of ASP.NET Core.

Let us explain what a command handler is and why you would want to \\nuse it. \\nThe Command pattern is intrinsically related to the CQRS pattern that was introduced earlier in this \\nguide. CQRS has two sides. The first area is queries, using simplified queries with the Dapper micro \\nORM, which was explained previously. The second area is commands, which are the starting point for \\ntransactions, and the input channel from outside the service. \\nAs shown in Figure 7-24, the pattern is based on accepting commands from the client-side, \\nprocessing them based on the domain model rules, and finally persisting the states with transactions.'),\n",

High-level view of the commands or “transactional side” in a CQRS pattern \\nFigure 7-24 shows that the UI app sends a command through the API that gets to a CommandHandler, \\nthat depends on the Domain model and the Infrastructure, to update the database.  \\nThe command class \\nA command is a request for the system to perform an action that changes the state of the system. \\nCommands are imperative, and should be processed just once. \\nSince commands are imperatives, they are typically named with a verb in the imperative mood (for \\nexample, “create” or “update”), and they might include the aggregate type, such as \\nCreateOrderCommand. Unlike an event, a command is not a fact from the past; it is only a request, \\nand thus may be refused. \\nCommands can originate from the UI as a result of a user initiating a request, or from a process \\nmanager when the process manager is directing an aggregate to perform an action.  \\nAn important characteristic of a command is that it should be processed just once by a single receiver. \\nThis is because a command is a single action or transaction you want to perfo rm in the application. \\nFor example, the same order creation command should not be processed more than once. This is an \\nimportant difference between commands and events. Events may be processed multiple times, \\nbecause many systems or microservices might be interested in the event. \\nIn addition, it is important that a command be processed only once in case the command is not \\nidempotent. A command is idempotent if it can be executed multiple times without changing the \\nresult, either because of the nature of the command, or because of the way the system handles the \\ncommand. \\nIt is a good practice to make your commands and updates idempotent when it makes sense under \\nyour domain’s business rules and invariants. For instance, to use the same example, if for any reas on \\n(retry logic, hacking, etc.) the same CreateOrder command reaches your system multiple times, you \\nshould be able to identify it and ensure that you do not create multiple orders. To do so, you need to \\nattach some kind of identity in the operations and identify whether the command or update was \\nalready processed.'),\n",

The command’s name indicates its purpose. In many languages like C#, \\ncommands are represented as classes, but they are not true classes in the real object-oriented sense. \\nAs an additional characteristic, commands are immutable, because the expected usage is that they are \\nprocessed directly by the domain model. They do not need to change during their projected lifetime. \\nIn a C# class, immutability can be achieved by not having any setters or other methods that change \\nthe internal state. \\nKeep in mind that if you intend or expect commands to go through a serializing/deserializing process, \\nthe properties must have a private setter, and the [DataMember] (or [JsonProperty]) attribute. \\nOtherwise, the deserializer won’t be able to reconstruct the object at the destination with the required \\nvalues. You can also use truly read-only properties if the class has a constructor with parameters for all \\nproperties, with the usual camelCase naming convention, and annotate the constructor as \\n[JsonConstructor]. However, this option requires more code. \\nFor example, the command class for creating an order is probably similar in terms of data to the order \\nyou want to create, but you probably do not need the same attributes. For instance, \\nCreateOrderCommand does not have an order ID, because the order has not been created yet. \\nMany command classes can be simple, requiring only a few fields about some state that needs to be \\nchanged. That would be the case if you are just changing the status of an order from “in process” to \\n“paid” or “shipped” by using a command similar to the following: \\n[DataContract] \\npublic class UpdateOrderStatusCommand \\n    :IRequest<bool> \\n{ \\n    [DataMember] \\n    public string Status { get; private set; } \\n \\n    [DataMember] \\n    public string OrderId { get; private set; } \\n \\n    [DataMember] \\n    public string BuyerIdentityGuid { get; private set; } \\n} \\nSome developers make their UI request objects separate from their command DTOs, but that is just a \\nmatter of preference.

For instance, in eShopOnContainers, some commands come directly \\nfrom the client-side. \\nThe Command handler class \\nYou should implement a specific command handler class for each command. That is how the pattern \\nworks, and it’s where you’ll use the command object, the domain objects, and the infrastructure \\nrepository objects. The command handler is in fact the heart of the application layer in terms of CQRS \\nand DDD. However, all the domain logic should be contained in the domain classes —within the \\naggregate roots (root entities), child entities, or domain services, but not within the command handler, \\nwhich is a class from the application layer.'),\n",

The \\nresult should be either successful execution of the command, or an exception. In the case of an \\nexception, the system state should be unchanged. \\nThe command handler usually takes the following steps: \\n• It receives the command object, like a DTO (from the mediator or other infrastructure object). \\n• It validates that the command is valid (if not validated by the mediator). \\n• It instantiates the aggregate root instance that is the target of the current command.  \\n• It executes the method on the aggregate root instance, getting the required data from the \\ncommand. \\n• It persists the new state of the aggregate to its related database. This last operation is the actual \\ntransaction. \\nTypically, a command handler deals with a single aggregate driven by its aggregate root (root entity). \\nIf multiple aggregates should be impacted by the reception of a single command, you could use \\ndomain events to propagate states or actions across multiple aggregates.  \\nThe important point here is that when a command is being processed, all the domain logic sh ould be \\ninside the domain model (the aggregates), fully encapsulated and ready for unit testing. The \\ncommand handler just acts as a way to get the domain model from the database, and as the final \\nstep, to tell the infrastructure layer (repositories) to persist the changes when the model is changed. \\nThe advantage of this approach is that you can refactor the domain logic in an isolated, fully \\nencapsulated, rich, behavioral domain model without changing code in the application or \\ninfrastructure layers, which are the plumbing level (command handlers, Web API, repositories, etc.).  \\nWhen command handlers get complex, with too much logic, that can be a code smell.

Using the Mediator pattern in process in a single CQRS microservice \\nThe above diagram shows a zoom-in from image 7-24: the ASP.NET Core controller sends the \\ncommand to MediatR’s command pipeline, so they get to the appropriate handler.  \\nThe reason that using the Mediator pattern makes sense is that in enterprise applica tions, the \\nprocessing requests can get complicated. You want to be able to add an open number of cross -\\ncutting concerns like logging, validations, audit, and security. In these cases, you can rely on a \\nmediator pipeline (see Mediator pattern) to provide a means for these extra behaviors or cross-\\ncutting concerns. \\nA mediator is an object that encapsulates the “how” of this process: it coordinates execution based on \\nstate, the way a command handler is invoked, or the payload you provide to the handler. With a \\nmediator component, you can apply cross-cutting concerns in a centralized and transparent way by \\napplying decorators (or pipeline behaviors since MediatR 3). For more information, see the Decorator \\npattern. \\nDecorators and behaviors are similar to Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP), only applied to a \\nspecific process pipeline managed by the mediator component. Aspects in AOP that implement cross -\\ncutting concerns are applied based on aspect weavers injected at compilation time or based on object \\ncall interception. Both typical AOP approaches are sometimes said to work “like magic,” because it is \\nnot easy to see how AOP does its work. When dealing with serious issues or bugs, AOP can be difficult \\nto debug. On the other hand, these decorators/behaviors are explicit and applied only in the context \\nof the mediator, so debugging is much more predictable and easy. \\nFor example, in the eShopOnContainers ordering microservice, has an implementation of two sample \\nbehaviors, a LogBehavior class and a ValidatorBehavior class. The implementation of the behaviors is \\nexplained in the next section by showing how eShopOnContainers uses MediatR behaviors.'),\n",

That option could also be combined with the mediator component right before the \\ncommand handler. \\n \\nFigure 7-26. Using message queues (out of the process and inter-process communication) with CQRS commands \\nCommand’s pipeline can also be handled by a high availability message queue to deliver the \\ncommands to the appropriate handler. Using message queues to accept the commands can further \\ncomplicate your command’s pipeline, because you will probably need to split the pipeline into two \\nprocesses connected through the external message queue. Still, it should be used if you need to have \\nimproved scalability and performance based on asynchronous messaging. Consider that in the case of \\nFigure 7-26, the controller just posts the command message into the queue and returns. Then the \\ncommand handlers process the messages at their own pace. That is a great benefit of queues: the \\nmessage queue can act as a buffer in cases when hyper scalability is needed, such as for stocks or any \\nother scenario with a high volume of ingress data. \\nHowever, because of the asynchronous nature of message queues, you need to figure out how to \\ncommunicate with the client application about the success or failure of the command’s process. As a \\nrule, you should never use “fire and forget” commands. Every business application needs to know if a \\ncommand was processed successfully, or at least validated and accepted.  \\nThus, being able to respond to the client after validating a command message that was submitted to \\nan asynchronous queue adds complexity to your system, as compared to an in-process command \\nprocess that returns the operation’s result after running the transaction. Using queues, you might \\nneed to return the result of the command process through other operation result messages, which will \\nrequire additional components and custom communication in your system.'),\n",

Why do they introduce this unnecessary complexity? And actually, I haven’t seen a CQRS code \\nexample with blocking command handlers so far, though it will work just fine in most cases.  \\n[Greg Young] […] an asynchronous command doesn’t exist; it’s actually another event. If I must accept \\nwhat you send me and raise an event if I disagree, it’s no longer you telling me to do something [that \\nis, it’s not a command]. It’s you telling me something has been done. This seems like a slight \\ndifference at first, but it has many implications. \\nAsynchronous commands greatly increase the complexity of a system, because there is no simple way \\nto indicate failures. Therefore, asynchronous commands are not recommended other than when \\nscaling requirements are needed or in special cases when communicating the internal microservices \\nthrough messaging. In those cases, you must design a separate reporting and recovery system for \\nfailures. \\nIn the initial version of eShopOnContainers, it was decided to use synchronous command p rocessing, \\nstarted from HTTP requests and driven by the Mediator pattern. That easily allows you to return the \\nsuccess or failure of the process, as in the CreateOrderCommandHandler implementation. \\nIn any case, this should be a decision based on your application’s or microservice’s business \\nrequirements. \\nImplement the command process pipeline with a mediator pattern \\n(MediatR) \\nAs a sample implementation, this guide proposes using the in-process pipeline based on the Mediator \\npattern to drive command ingestion and route commands, in memory, to the right command \\nhandlers. The guide also proposes applying behaviors in order to separate cross-cutting concerns. \\nFor implementation in .NET, there are multiple open-source libraries available that implement the \\nMediator pattern. The library used in this guide is the MediatR open-source library (created by Jimmy \\nBogard), but you could use another approach. MediatR is a small and simple library that allows you to \\nprocess in-memory messages like a command, while applying decorators or behaviors.  \\nUsing the Mediator pattern helps you to reduce coupling and to isolate the concerns of the requ ested \\nwork, while automatically connecting to the handler that performs that work—in this case, to \\ncommand handlers. \\nAnother good reason to use the Mediator pattern was explained by Jimmy Bogard when reviewing \\nthis guide:'),\n",

Request-in, response-out. We’ve found that aspect quite valuable in building \\nconsistently behaving tests. \\nFirst, let’s look at a sample WebAPI controller where you actually would use the mediator object. If \\nyou weren’t using the mediator object, you’d need to inject all the dependencies for that controller, \\nthings like a logger object and others. Therefore, the constructor would be complicated. On the other \\nhand, if you use the mediator object, the constructor of your controller can be a lot simpler, with just a \\nfew dependencies instead of many dependencies if you had one per cross-cutting operation, as in the \\nfollowing example: \\npublic class MyMicroserviceController : Controller \\n{ \\n    public MyMicroserviceController(IMediator mediator, \\n                                    IMyMicroserviceQueries microserviceQueries) \\n    { \\n        // ... \\n    } \\n} \\nYou can see that the mediator provides a clean and lean Web API controller constructor. In addition, \\nwithin the controller methods, the code to send a command to the mediator object is almost one line:  \\n[Route(\"new\")] \\n[HttpPost] \\npublic async Task<IActionResult> ExecuteBusinessOperation([FromBody]RunOpCommand \\n                                                               runOperationCommand) \\n{ \\n    var commandResult = await _mediator.SendAsync(runOperationCommand); \\n \\n    return commandResult ? (IActionResult)Ok() : (IActionResult)BadRequest(); \\n} \\nImplement idempotent Commands \\nIn eShopOnContainers, a more advanced example than the above is submitting a \\nCreateOrderCommand object from the Ordering microservice. But since the Ordering business \\nprocess is a bit more complex and, in our case, it actually starts in the Basket microservice, this action \\nof submitting the CreateOrderCommand object is performed from an integration-event handler \\nnamed UserCheckoutAcceptedIntegrationEventHandler instead of a simple WebAPI controller called \\nfrom the client App as in the previous simpler example. \\nNevertheless, the action of submitting the Command to MediatR is pretty similar, as shown in the \\nfollowing code. \\nvar createOrderCommand = new CreateOrderCommand(eventMsg.Basket.Items, \\n                                                eventMsg.UserId, eventMsg.City, \\n                                                eventMsg.Street, eventMsg.State, \\n                                                eventMsg.Country, eventMsg.ZipCode, \\n                                                eventMsg.CardNumber, \\n                                                eventMsg.CardHolderName, \\n                                                eventMsg.CardExpiration, \\n                                                eventMsg.CardSecurityNumber, \\n                                                eventMsg.CardTypeId);'),\n",

The CreateOrderCommand process should be idempotent, so if the same message comes \\nduplicated through the network, because of any reason, like retries, the same business order will be \\nprocessed just once. \\nThis is implemented by wrapping the business command (in this case CreateOrderCommand) and \\nembedding it into a generic IdentifiedCommand, which is tracked by an ID of every message coming \\nthrough the network that has to be idempotent. \\nIn the code below, you can see that the IdentifiedCommand is nothing more than a DTO with and ID \\nplus the wrapped business command object. \\npublic class IdentifiedCommand<T, R> : IRequest<R> \\n    where T : IRequest<R> \\n{ \\n    public T Command { get; } \\n    public Guid Id { get; } \\n    public IdentifiedCommand(T command, Guid id) \\n    { \\n        Command = command; \\n        Id = id; \\n    } \\n} \\nThen the CommandHandler for the IdentifiedCommand named IdentifiedCommandHandler.cs will \\nbasically check if the ID coming as part of the message already exists in a table.

You must design your application to be resilient to those partial failures.  \\nResiliency is the ability to recover from failures and continue to function. It isn’t about avoiding \\nfailures but accepting the fact that failures will happen and responding to them in a way that avoids \\ndowntime or data loss. The goal of resiliency is to return the application to a fully functioning state \\nafter a failure. \\nIt’s challenging enough to design and deploy a microservices-based application. But you also need to \\nkeep your application running in an environment where some sort of failure is certain. Therefore, your \\napplication should be resilient. It should be designed to cope with partial failures, like networ k \\noutages or nodes or VMs crashing in the cloud. Even microservices (containers) being moved to a \\ndifferent node within a cluster can cause intermittent short failures within the application.  \\nThe many individual components of your application should also incorporate health monitoring \\nfeatures. By following the guidelines in this chapter, you can create an application that can work \\nsmoothly in spite of transient downtime or the normal hiccups that occur in complex and cloud -based \\ndeployments. \\nImportant \\neShopOnContainer had been using the Polly library to implement resiliency using Typed Clients up \\nuntil the release 3.0.0. \\nStarting with release 3.0.0, the HTTP calls resiliency is implemented using a Linkerd mesh, that handles \\nretries in a transparent and configurable fashion, within a Kubernetes cluster, without havin g to \\nhandle those concerns in the code. \\nThe Polly library is still used to add resilience to database connections, specially while starting up the \\nservices. \\n \\n \\nWarning \\nAll code samples and images in this section were valid before using Linkerd and are not u pdated to \\nreflect the current actual code. So they make sense in the context of this section.'),\n",

For instance, a single microservice/container can fail or might not be available to respond for a \\nshort time, or a single VM or server can crash. Since clients and services are separate processes, a \\nservice might not be able to respond in a timely way to a client’s request. The service might be \\noverloaded and responding very slowly to requests or might simply not be accessible for a short time \\nbecause of network issues. \\nFor example, consider the Order details page from the eShopOnContainers sample application. If the \\nordering microservice is unresponsive when the user tries to submit an order, a bad implementation \\nof the client process (the MVC web application)—for example, if the client code were to use \\nsynchronous RPCs with no timeout—would block threads indefinitely waiting for a response. Besides \\ncreating a bad user experience, every unresponsive wait consumes or blocks a thread, and threads are \\nextremely valuable in highly scalable applications. If there are many blocked threads, eventually the \\napplication’s runtime can run out of threads. In that case, the application can become globally \\nunresponsive instead of just partially unresponsive, as shown in Figure 8-1. \\n \\nFigure 8-1. Partial failures because of dependencies that impact service thread availability \\nIn a large microservices-based application, any partial failure can be amplified, especially if most of \\nthe internal microservices interaction is based on synchronous HTTP calls (which is considered an anti -\\npattern). Think about a system that receives millions of incoming calls per day. If your system has a \\nbad design that’s based on long chains of synchronous HTTP calls, these incoming calls might result in \\nmany more millions of outgoing calls (let’s suppose a ratio of 1:4) to dozens of internal microservices \\nas synchronous dependencies. This situation is shown in Figure 8-2, especially dependency #3, that \\nstarts a chain, calling dependency #4, which then calls #5.'),\n",

The impact of having an incorrect design featuring long chains of HTTP requests \\nIntermittent failure is guaranteed in a distributed and cloud-based system, even if every dependency \\nitself has excellent availability.

It’s highly advisable not to create long chains of synchronous HTTP calls \\nacross the internal microservices because that incorrect design will eventually become the main cause \\nof bad outages. On the contrary, except for the front-end communications between the client \\napplications and the first level of microservices or fine-grained API Gateways, it’s recommended to use \\nonly asynchronous (message-based) communication once past the initial request/response cycle, \\nacross the internal microservices. Eventual consistency and event-driven architectures will help to \\nminimize ripple effects. These approaches enforce a higher level of microservice autonomy and \\ntherefore prevent against the problem noted here. \\nUse retries with exponential backoff. This technique helps to avoid short and intermittent failures \\nby performing call retries a certain number of times, in case the service was not available only for a \\nshort time. This might occur due to intermittent network issues or when a microservice/container is \\nmoved to a different node in a cluster. However, if these retries are not designed properly with circuit \\nbreakers, it can aggravate the ripple effects, ultimately even causing a Denial of Service (DoS). \\nWork around network timeouts. In general, clients should be designed not to block indefinitely and \\nto always use timeouts when waiting for a response. Using timeouts ensures that resources ar e never \\ntied up indefinitely. \\nUse the Circuit Breaker pattern. In this approach, the client process tracks the number of failed \\nrequests. If the error rate exceeds a configured limit, a “circuit breaker” trips so that further attempts \\nfail immediately. (If a large number of requests are failing, that suggests the service is unavailable and \\nthat sending requests is pointless.) After a timeout period, the client should try again and, if the new \\nrequests are successful, close the circuit breaker. \\nProvide fallbacks. In this approach, the client process performs fallback logic when a request fails, \\nsuch as returning cached data or a default value. This is an approach suitable for queries, and is more \\ncomplex for updates or commands. \\nLimit the number of queued requests. Clients should also impose an upper bound on the number \\nof outstanding requests that a client microservice can send to a particular service. If the limit has been \\nreached, it’s probably pointless to make additional requests, and those attempts shoul d fail \\nimmediately. In terms of implementation, the Polly Bulkhead Isolation policy can be used to fulfill this \\nrequirement. This approach is essentially a parallelization throttle with SemaphoreSlim as the \\nimplementation. It also permits a “queue” outside the bulkhead.

You can \\nimplement those capabilities by applying Polly policies such as Retry, Circuit Breaker, Bulkhead \\nIsolation, Timeout, and Fallback. Polly targets .NET Framework 4.x and .NET Standard 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 \\n(which supports .NET Core and later). \\nThe following steps show how you can use Http retries with Polly integrated into \\nIHttpClientFactory, which is explained in the previous section. \\nReference the .NET 6 packages \\nIHttpClientFactory is available since .NET Core 2.1 however we recommend you to use the latest \\n.NET 6 packages from NuGet in your project. You typically also need to reference the extension \\npackage Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Polly. \\nConfigure a client with Polly’s Retry policy, in Startup \\nAs shown in previous sections, you need to define a named or typed client HttpClient configuration in \\nyour standard Startup.ConfigureServices(…) method, but now, you add incremental code specifying \\nthe policy for the Http retries with exponential backoff, as below: \\n//ConfigureServices()  - Startup.cs \\nservices.AddHttpClient<IBasketService, BasketService>() \\n        .SetHandlerLifetime(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5))  //Set lifetime to five minutes \\n        .AddPolicyHandler(GetRetryPolicy()); \\nThe AddPolicyHandler() method is what adds policies to the HttpClient objects you’ll use. In this \\ncase, it’s adding a Polly’s policy for Http Retries with exponential backoff. \\nTo have a more modular approach, the Http Retry Policy can be defined in a separate method within \\nthe Startup.cs file, as shown in the following code: \\nstatic IAsyncPolicy<HttpResponseMessage> GetRetryPolicy() \\n{ \\n    return HttpPolicyExtensions \\n        .HandleTransientHttpError() \\n        .OrResult(msg => msg.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.NotFound) \\n        .WaitAndRetryAsync(6, retryAttempt => TimeSpan.FromSeconds(Math.Pow(2, \\n                                                                    retryAttempt))); \\n} \\nWith Polly, you can define a Retry policy with the number of retries, the exponential backoff \\nconfiguration, and the actions to take when there’s an HTTP exception, such as logging the error. In \\nthis case, the policy is configured to try six times with an exponential retry, starting at two seconds.'),\n",

To overcome peaks of similar retries coming from many clients in partial outages, a \\ngood workaround is to add a jitter strategy to the retry algorithm/policy. This strategy can improve \\nthe overall performance of the end-to-end system. As recommended in Polly: Retry with Jitter, a good \\njitter strategy can be implemented by smooth and evenly distributed retry intervals applied with a \\nwell-controlled median initial retry delay on an exponential backoff.

As a microservice fails or performs slowly, multiple clients might repeatedly retry failed \\nrequests. That creates a dangerous risk of exponentially increasing traffic targeted at the failing \\nservice. \\nTherefore, you need some kind of defense barrier so that excessive requests stop when it isn’t worth \\nto keep trying. That defense barrier is precisely the circuit breaker. \\nThe Circuit Breaker pattern has a different purpose than the “Retry pattern”. The “Retry pattern” \\nenables an application to retry an operation in the expectation that the operation will eventually \\nsucceed. The Circuit Breaker pattern prevents an application from performing an operation that’s \\nlikely to fail. An application can combine these two patterns. However, the retry logic should be \\nsensitive to any exception returned by the circuit breaker, and it should abandon retry attempts  if the \\ncircuit breaker indicates that a fault is not transient. \\nImplement Circuit Breaker pattern with IHttpClientFactory and Polly \\nAs when implementing retries, the recommended approach for circuit breakers is to take advantage of \\nproven .NET libraries like Polly and its native integration with IHttpClientFactory. \\nAdding a circuit breaker policy into your IHttpClientFactory outgoing middleware pipeline is as \\nsimple as adding a single incremental piece of code to what you already have when using \\nIHttpClientFactory. \\nThe only addition here to the code used for HTTP call retries is the code where you add the Circuit \\nBreaker policy to the list of policies to use, as shown in the following incremental code, part of the \\nConfigureServices() method. \\n//ConfigureServices()  - Startup.cs \\nvar retryPolicy = GetRetryPolicy(); \\nvar circuitBreakerPolicy = GetCircuitBreakerPolicy(); \\n \\nservices.AddHttpClient<IBasketService, BasketService>() \\n        .SetHandlerLifetime(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5))  // Sample: default lifetime is 2 \\nminutes \\n        .AddHttpMessageHandler<HttpClientAuthorizationDelegatingHandler>() \\n        .AddPolicyHandler(retryPolicy) \\n        .AddPolicyHandler(circuitBreakerPolicy); \\nThe AddPolicyHandler() method is what adds policies to the HttpClient objects you’ll use.

When that happens, \\nthe circuit will break for 30 seconds: in that period, calls will be failed immediately by the circuit -\\nbreaker rather than actually be placed. The policy automatically interprets relevant exceptions and \\nHTTP status codes as faults. \\nCircuit breakers should also be used to redirect requests to a fallback infrastructure if you had issues \\nin a particular resource that’s deployed in a different environment than the client application or \\nservice that’s performing the HTTP call. That way, if there’s an outage in the datacenter that impacts \\nonly your backend microservices but not your client applications, the client applications can redirect \\nto the fallback services. Polly is planning a new policy to automate this failover policy scenario. \\nAll those features are for cases where you’re managing the failover from within the .NET code, as \\nopposed to having it managed automatically for you by Azure, with location transparency.  \\nFrom a usage point of view, when using HttpClient, there’s no need to add anything new here \\nbecause the code is the same than when using HttpClient with IHttpClientFactory, as shown in \\nprevious sections. \\nTest Http retries and circuit breakers in eShopOnContainers \\nWhenever you start the eShopOnContainers solution in a Docker host, it needs to star t multiple \\ncontainers. Some of the containers are slower to start and initialize, like the SQL Server container. This \\nis especially true the first time you deploy the eShopOnContainers application into Docker because it \\nneeds to set up the images and the database. The fact that some containers start slower than others \\ncan cause the rest of the services to initially throw HTTP exceptions, even if you set dependencies \\nbetween containers at the docker-compose level, as explained in previous sections. Those docker-\\ncompose dependencies between containers are just at the process level. The container’s entry point \\nprocess might be started, but SQL Server might not be ready for queries. The result can be a cascade \\nof errors, and the application can get an exception when trying to consume that particular container. \\nYou might also see this type of error on startup when the application is deploying to the cloud. In that \\ncase, orchestrators might be moving containers from one node or VM to another (that is, starting new \\ninstances) when balancing the number of containers across the cluster’s nodes.  \\nThe way ‘eShopOnContainers’ solves those issues when starting all the containers is by using the Retry \\npattern illustrated earlier. \\nTest the circuit breaker in eShopOnContainers \\nThere are a few ways you can break/open the circuit and test it with eShopOnContainers.  \\nOne option is to lower the allowed number of retries to 1 in the circuit breaker policy and redeploy \\nthe whole solution into Docker. With a single retry, there’s a good chance that an HTTP request will \\nfail during deployment, the circuit breaker will open, and you get an error.  \\nAnother option is to use custom middleware that’s implemented in the Basket microservice. When \\nthis middleware is enabled, it catches all HTTP requests and returns status code 500. You can enable \\nthe middleware by making a GET request to the failing URI, like the following:'),\n",

If \\nyou invest in high-quality health reporting that’s customized for your application, you can detect and \\nfix issues for your running application much more easily. \\nImplement health checks in ASP.NET Core services \\nWhen developing an ASP.NET Core microservice or web application, you can use the built -in health \\nchecks feature that was released in ASP .NET Core 2.2 \\n(Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks).

When you use this feature, you can also decide what it means that the resource is \\nhealthy, as we explain later. \\nTo use this feature effectively, you need to first configure services in your microservices. Second, you \\nneed a front-end application that queries for the health reports. That front-end application could be a \\ncustom reporting application, or it could be an orchestrator itself that can react accordingly to the \\nhealth states. \\nUse the HealthChecks feature in your back-end ASP.NET microservices \\nIn this section, you’ll learn how to implement the HealthChecks feature in a sample ASP.NET Core 6.0 \\nWeb API application when using the Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks package. The \\nImplementation of this feature in a large-scale microservices like the eShopOnContainers is explained \\nin the next section. \\nTo begin, you need to define what constitutes a healthy status for each microservice. In the sample \\napplication, we define the microservice is healthy if its API is accessible via HTTP and its related SQL \\nServer database is also available. \\nIn .NET 6, with the built-in APIs, you can configure the services, add a Health Check for the \\nmicroservice and its dependent SQL Server database in this way: \\n// Startup.cs from .NET 6 Web API sample \\n// \\npublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) \\n{ \\n    //... \\n    // Registers required services for health checks \\n    services.AddHealthChecks() \\n        // Add a health check for a SQL Server database \\n        .AddCheck( \\n            \"OrderingDB-check\", \\n            new SqlConnectionHealthCheck(Configuration[\"ConnectionString\"]), \\n            HealthStatus.Unhealthy, \\n            new string[] { \"orderingdb\" }); \\n}'),\n",

When an \\norchestrator determines that a service/container is unhealthy, it stops routing requests to that \\ninstance. It also usually creates a new instance of that container. \\nFor instance, most orchestrators can use health checks to manage zero-downtime deployments. Only \\nwhen the status of a service/container changes to healthy will the orchestrator start routing traffic to \\nservice/container instances. \\nHealth monitoring is especially important when an orchestrator performs an application upgrade. \\nSome orchestrators (like Azure Service Fabric) update services in phases—for example, they might \\nupdate one-fifth of the cluster surface for each application upgrade. The set of nodes that’s upgraded \\nat the same time is referred to as an upgrade domain. After each upgrade domain has been upgraded \\nand is available to users, that upgrade domain must pass health checks before the deployment mo ves \\nto the next upgrade domain. \\nAnother aspect of service health is reporting metrics from the service. This is an advanced capability of \\nthe health model of some orchestrators, like Service Fabric. Metrics are important when using an \\norchestrator because they are used to balance resource usage. Metrics also can be an indicator of \\nsystem health. For example, you might have an application that has many microservices, and each \\ninstance reports a requests-per-second (RPS) metric. If one service is using more resources (memory, \\nprocessor, etc.) than another service, the orchestrator could move service instances around in the \\ncluster to try to maintain even resource utilization. \\nNote that Azure Service Fabric provides its own Health Monitoring model, which is more advanced \\nthan simple health checks. \\nAdvanced monitoring: visualization, analysis, and alerts \\nThe final part of monitoring is visualizing the event stream, reporting on service performance, and \\nalerting when an issue is detected.

You configure IdentityServer4 in Startup.ConfigureServices by making a call to \\nservices.AddIdentityServer. \\n3. You configure identity server by setting the following data: \\n– The credentials to use for signing. \\n– The Identity and API resources that users might request access to: \\n• API resources represent protected data or functionality that a user can access \\nwith an access token.

A \\nsimplified example of how to use middleware to consume such tokens might look like this code \\nfragment, taken from the Ordering.Api microservice of eShopOnContainers. \\n// Startup.cs \\n \\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env) \\n{ \\n    //… \\n    // Configure the pipeline to use authentication \\n    app.UseAuthentication(); \\n    //… \\n    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints => \\n    { \\n        //... \\n    }); \\n} \\n \\npublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) \\n{ \\n    var identityUrl = Configuration.GetValue<string>(\"IdentityUrl\"); \\n \\n    // Add Authentication services \\n \\n    services.AddAuthentication(options => \\n    { \\n        options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = \\nAspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme; \\n        options.DefaultChallengeScheme = \\nAspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme; \\n \\n    }).AddJwtBearer(options => \\n    { \\n        options.Authority = identityUrl; \\n        options.RequireHttpsMetadata = false; \\n        options.Audience = \"orders\"; \\n    }); \\n} \\nThe parameters in this usage are:'),\n",

This process allows a service \\nto make APIs available to some authenticated users, but not to all. Authorization can be done based \\non users’ roles or based on custom policy, which might include inspecting claims or other heuristics.  \\nRestricting access to an ASP.NET Core MVC route is as easy as applying an Authorize attribute to the \\naction method (or to the controller’s class if all the controller’s actions require authorization), as \\nshown in following example: \\npublic class AccountController : Controller \\n{ \\n    public ActionResult Login() \\n    { \\n    } \\n \\n    [Authorize] \\n    public ActionResult Logout() \\n    { \\n    } \\n} \\nBy default, adding an Authorize attribute without parameters will limit access to authenticated users \\nfor that controller or action. To further restrict an API to be available for only specific users, the \\nattribute can be expanded to specify required roles or policies that users must satisfy.  \\nImplement role-based authorization \\nASP.NET Core Identity has a built-in concept of roles. In addition to users, ASP.NET Core Identity \\nstores information about different roles used by the application and keeps track of which users are \\nassigned to which roles. These assignments can be changed programmatically with the RoleManager \\ntype that updates roles in persisted storage, and the UserManager type that can grant or revoke roles \\nfrom users. \\nIf you’re authenticating with JWT bearer tokens, the ASP.NET Core JWT bearer authentication \\nmiddleware will populate a user’s roles based on role claims found in the token. To limit access to an \\nMVC action or controller to users in specific roles, you can include a Roles parameter in the Authorize \\nannotation (attribute), as shown in the following code fragment: \\n[Authorize(Roles = \"Administrator, PowerUser\")] \\npublic class ControlPanelController : Controller \\n{ \\n    public ActionResult SetTime() \\n    { \\n    } \\n \\n    [Authorize(Roles = \"Administrator\")] \\n    public ActionResult ShutDown() \\n    { \\n    } \\n}'),\n",

The ShutDown API is further restricted \\nto allow access only to users in the Administrator role. \\nTo require a user be in multiple roles, you use multiple Authorize attributes, as shown in the following \\nexample: \\n[Authorize(Roles = \"Administrator, PowerUser\")] \\n[Authorize(Roles = \"RemoteEmployee \")] \\n[Authorize(Policy = \"CustomPolicy\")] \\npublic ActionResult API1 () \\n{ \\n} \\nIn this example, to call API1, a user must: \\n• Be in the Administrator or PowerUser role, and \\n• Be in the RemoteEmployee role, and \\n• Satisfy a custom handler for CustomPolicy authorization. \\nImplement policy-based authorization \\nCustom authorization rules can also be written using authorization policies. This section provides an \\noverview. For more information, see the ASP.NET Authorization Workshop. \\nCustom authorization policies are registered in the Startup.ConfigureServices method using the \\nservice.AddAuthorization method. This method takes a delegate that configures  an \\nAuthorizationOptions argument. \\nservices.AddAuthorization(options => \\n{ \\n    options.AddPolicy(\"AdministratorsOnly\", policy => \\n        policy.RequireRole(\"Administrator\")); \\n \\n    options.AddPolicy(\"EmployeesOnly\", policy => \\n        policy.RequireClaim(\"EmployeeNumber\")); \\n \\n    options.AddPolicy(\"Over21\", policy => \\n        policy.Requirements.Add(new MinimumAgeRequirement(21))); \\n}); \\nAs shown in the example, policies can be associated with different types of requirements. After the \\npolicies are registered, they can be applied to an action or controller by passing the policy’s name as \\nthe Policy argument of the Authorize attribute (for example, \\n[Authorize(Policy=\"EmployeesOnly\")]) Policies can have multiple requirements, not just one (as \\nshown in these examples). \\nIn the previous example, the first AddPolicy call is just an alternative way of authorizing by role. If \\n[Authorize(Policy=\"AdministratorsOnly\")] is applied to an API, only users in the Administrator \\nrole will be able to access it.'),\n",

The RequireClaim method also optionally takes expected values for the claim. If \\nvalues are specified, the requirement is met only if the user has both a claim of the correct type and \\none of the specified values. If you’re using the JWT bearer authentication middleware, all JWT \\nproperties will be available as user claims. \\nThe most interesting policy shown here is in the third AddPolicy method, because it uses a custom \\nauthorization requirement. By using custom authorization requirements, you can have a great deal of \\ncontrol over how authorization is performed. For this to work, you must implement these types:  \\n• A Requirements type that derives from IAuthorizationRequirement and that contains fields \\nspecifying the details of the requirement. In the example, this is an age field for the sample \\nMinimumAgeRequirement type. \\n• A handler that implements AuthorizationHandler, where T is the type of \\nIAuthorizationRequirement that the handler can satisfy. The handler must implement the \\nHandleRequirementAsync method, which checks whether a specified context that contains \\ninformation about the user satisfies the requirement. \\nIf the user meets the requirement, a call to context.Succeed will indicate that the user is authorized. \\nIf there are multiple ways that a user might satisfy an authorization requirement, multiple handlers can \\nbe created. \\nIn addition to registering custom policy requirements with AddPolicy calls, you also need to register \\ncustom requirement handlers via Dependency Injection \\n(services.AddTransient<IAuthorizationHandler, MinimumAgeHandler>()). \\nAn example of a custom authorization requirement and handler for checking a user’s age (based on a \\nDateOfBirth claim) is available in the ASP.NET Core authorization documentation. \\nAdditional resources \\n• ASP.NET Core Authentication \\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity \\n• ASP.NET Core Authorization \\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/authorization/introduction \\n• Role-based Authorization \\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/authorization/roles \\n• Custom Policy-Based Authorization \\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/authorization/policies \\nStore application secrets safely during development \\nTo connect with protected resources and other services, ASP.NET Core applications typically need to \\nuse connection strings, passwords, or other credentials that contain sensitive information.

Instead, you should use the ASP.NET \\nCore configuration model to read the secrets from more secure locations.  \\nYou must separate the secrets for accessing development and staging resources from the ones used \\nfor accessing production resources, because different individuals will need access to t hose different \\nsets of secrets. To store secrets used during development, common approaches are to either store \\nsecrets in environment variables or by using the ASP.NET Core Secret Manager tool. For more secure \\nstorage in production environments, microservices can store secrets in an Azure Key Vault. \\nStore secrets in environment variables \\nOne way to keep secrets out of source code is for developers to set string-based secrets as \\nenvironment variables on their development machines. When you use environment variables to store \\nsecrets with hierarchical names, such as the ones nested in configuration sections, you must name the \\nvariables to include the complete hierarchy of its sections, delimited with colons (:).  \\nFor example, setting an environment variable Logging:LogLevel:Default to Debug value would be \\nequivalent to a configuration value from the following JSON file: \\n{ \\n    \"Logging\": { \\n        \"LogLevel\": { \\n            \"Default\": \"Debug\" \\n        } \\n    } \\n} \\nTo access these values from environment variables, the application just needs to call \\nAddEnvironmentVariables on its ConfigurationBuilder when constructing an IConfigurationRoot \\nobject. \\nNote \\nEnvironment variables are commonly stored as plain text, so if the machine or process with the \\nenvironment variables is compromised, the environment variable values will be visible.  \\nStore secrets with the ASP.NET Core Secret Manager \\nThe ASP.NET Core Secret Manager tool provides another method of keeping secrets out of source \\ncode during development. To use the Secret Manager tool, install the package \\nMicrosoft.Extensions.Configuration.SecretManager in your project file. Once that dependency is \\npresent and has been restored, the dotnet user-secrets command can be used to set the value of \\nsecrets from the command line. These secrets will be stored in a JSON file in the user’s profile \\ndirectory (details vary by OS), away from source code. \\nSecrets set by the Secret Manager tool are organized by the UserSecretsId property of the project \\nthat’s using the secrets. Therefore, you must be sure to set the UserSecretsId property in your project \\nfile, as shown in the snippet below. The default value is a GUID assigned by Visual Studio, but the \\nactual string is not important as long as it’s unique in your computer.'),\n",

Container-based solutions provide important cost savings because \\nthey help reduce deployment problems caused by failing dependencies in production en vironments. \\nContainers significantly improve DevOps and production operations. \\nContainers will be ubiquitous. Docker-based containers are becoming the de facto standard in the \\nindustry, supported by key vendors in the Windows and Linux ecosystems, such as Microsoft, Amazon \\nAWS, Google, and IBM. Docker will probably soon be ubiquitous in both the cloud and on -premises \\ndatacenters. \\nContainers as a unit of deployment. A Docker container is becoming the standard unit of \\ndeployment for any server-based application or service. \\nMicroservices. The microservices architecture is becoming the preferred approach for distributed and \\nlarge or complex mission-critical applications based on many independent subsystems in the form of \\nautonomous services. In a microservice-based architecture, the application is built as a collection of \\nservices that are developed, tested, versioned, deployed, and scaled independently. Each service can \\ninclude any related autonomous database. \\nDomain-driven design and SOA. The microservices architecture patterns derive from service-\\noriented architecture (SOA) and domain-driven design (DDD). When you design and develop \\nmicroservices for environments with evolving business needs and rules, it’s important to consider DDD \\napproaches and patterns. \\nMicroservices challenges. Microservices offer many powerful capabilities, like independent \\ndeployment, strong subsystem boundaries, and technology diversity. However, they also raise many \\nnew challenges related to distributed application development, such as fragmented and independent \\ndata models, resilient communication between microservices, eventual consistency, and operational \\ncomplexity that results from aggregating logging and monitoring information from multiple \\nmicroservices. These aspects introduce a much higher complexity level than a traditional monolithic \\napplication. As a result, only specific scenarios are suitable for microservice-based applications. These \\ninclude large and complex applications with multiple evolving subsystems. In these cases, i t’s worth \\ninvesting in a more complex software architecture, because it will provide better long -term agility and \\napplication maintenance.'),\n",

Containers are convenient for microservices, but can also be useful \\nfor monolithic applications based on the traditional .NET Framework, when using Windows \\nContainers. The benefits of using Docker, such as solving many deployment-to-production issues and \\nproviding state-of-the-art Dev and Test environments, apply to many different types of applications. \\nCLI versus IDE. With Microsoft tools, you can develop containerized .NET applications using your \\npreferred approach. You can develop with a CLI and an editor-based environment by using the Docker \\nCLI and Visual Studio Code. Or you can use an IDE-focused approach with Visual Studio and its unique \\nfeatures for Docker, such as multi-container debugging. \\nResilient cloud applications. In cloud-based systems and distributed systems in general, there is \\nalways the risk of partial failure. Since clients and services are separate processes (containers), a \\nservice might not be able to respond in a timely way to a client’s request. For example, a service might \\nbe down because of a partial failure or for maintenance; the service might be overloaded and \\nresponding slowly to requests; or it might not be accessible for a short time because of network \\nissues. Therefore, a cloud-based application must embrace those failures and have a strategy in place \\nto respond to those failures. These strategies can include retry policies (resending messages or \\nretrying requests) and implementing circuit-breaker patterns to avoid exponential load of repeated \\nrequests. Basically, cloud-based applications must have resilient mechanisms—either based on cloud \\ninfrastructure or custom, as the high-level ones provided by orchestrators or service buses. \\nSecurity. Our modern world of containers and microservices can expose new vulnerabilities. There are \\nseveral ways to implement basic application security, based on authentication and authorization. \\nHowever, container security must consider additional key components that result in inherently safer \\napplications. A critical element of building safer apps is having a secure way of communicating with \\nother apps and systems, something that often requires credentials, tokens, passwords, and the like, \\ncommonly referred to as application secrets. Any secure solution must follow security best practices, \\nsuch as encrypting secrets while in transit and at rest, and preventing secrets from leaking w hen \\nconsumed by the final application. Those secrets need to be stored and kept safely, as when using \\nAzure Key Vault. \\nOrchestrators. Container-based orchestrators, such as Azure Kubernetes Service and Azure Service \\nFabric are key part of any significant microservice and container-based application. These applications \\ncarry with them high complexity, scalability needs, and go through constant evolution. This guide has \\nintroduced orchestrators and their role in microservice-based and container-based solutions. If your \\napplication needs are moving you toward complex containerized apps, you will find it useful to seek \\nout additional resources for learning more about orchestrators.')]"
